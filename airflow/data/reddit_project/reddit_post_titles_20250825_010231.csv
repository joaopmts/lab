You have the older players who played right from the beginning, trying to go to the “roots” of battlefield with their ideal game focused on squad based combat and a rewarding teamplay experience without the NEED for extremely large maps and want something they can just hop on with friends.

Then you have the main base which is the battlefield 3-4 playerbase who all want the game to basically be exactly like those other games with large maps, loads of vehicles and a ttk/gunplay similar to that of the previous games. I may be controversial saying this, but this section seems a bit too stuck to their ideals of what Battlefield should be and don’t like the direction it’s going in.

Lastly, you have the “newer” players from BF1 onwards who love the faster gameplay and definitely enjoy/praise the atmosphere of the recent games despite both BFV and 2042 having rocky launches. It seems as though these players tend to suggest to add more out there things to the game like the weather system in 2042 to bf6 and generally seem to be somewhat disliked by the other two groups for not really conforming to their set-in-stone ideals of battlefield. 

I feel like the community is somewhat at war right now and I feel like DICE is doing the right thing by trying to listen but at the same time 1) we’ve only played a Beta so things will change 2) if we pull them in too many directions it might negatively impact the game.

I have to say, i could not really perform the same way i did when i was using a controller on BF4. 

I binded the pitch settings, was opening up the map, using free look. Still, could not drop more than 30 kills in a Jet game. 

Helicopter felt very difficult to maintain in low altitude. All in all, the controls were way easier with controller, at least in the Heli.

Now, when it comes to the ""meta"" per say, with aircraft, is it KBM? Im asking because i dont mind taking the time out to practice it with KBM just because i used to play BF4 on the xbox one, maybe its easier at the moment for me with controller.

Preface: Is this the state as battlefield as a whole or is it just 2042. Is this game unplayable to you? 

Im really pumped for BF6. I couldn't play the beta. When 2042 went of sale for 3$, Im like hell let me get my battlefield fix.

Is it me or is The game sometimes feels unplayable though? Like maybe 64v64 is to much, but it's like I spawn. I try being a bit tactical, clear corners, etc. Then die from random bs before i fire my gun. I respawn. Through caution to the wind, 'COD it up' I die without getting to fire my gun. I respawn, do some variation 5 more times before I get in solid gunfight, then probably die again. 

Is that just the nature of 2042 and 64v64 combat? Or is that how bf6 beta was.

Let me know. Thanks.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mz87vp/bf_2042_road_to_bf6_is_this_bf_or_is_it_just_2042/,Battlefield,1756071284.0,11,0.54,Battlefield 2042

Have temperature issues,ListRepresentative32,False,True,False,,False,"Well, I think I made little mistake with this. I recently bought a 9950X3D which the previous owner delided and used liquid metal. I did so because he was selling it for a price of 9950X, and it sounded like a good deal. 

I thought what could possibly go wrong, CPUs dont usually go bad, and the seller said he will reglue the IHS. 

When it arrived, I put it into a brand new motherboard (ASUS X870 MAX GAMING WIFI 7) together with Arctic liquid freezer iii 360 AIO. Tested everything works correctly and went onto playing BF6 beta. 

Right there was when I noticed the temps were not that nice, averaging around 85C while the CPU was pulling somewhere between 100-120W iirc. When running Cinebench 2024, and under full load, the CPU power was around 162W tops while the temps were hitting 95C. My idle temperature is around 52C. 

Although I know the CPUs are designed for these temps and my cinebench score was roughly the same as other peoples on the internet, it still kinda sucks. 

I have tried repasting twice, didnt make a noticable difference. Is there a chance the seller reglued the IHS wrong? One thing i definitely noticed is, that the seller probably used liquid metal even between the IHS and the cooler, as the top of the IHS looks weird. It looks like small drops of liquid metal are on it. Maybe that is what causes bad contact with the AIO. 

I tried cleaning it with the wipes that come with MX-6 thermal paste bundle, but thats obviously not going to do anything if its metal. Before I resort to some really dumb potentially destructive methods, i wanted to ask a second opinion.

The picture below shows the CPU after all the cleaning attempts.

Last night I was playing Delta Force with a couple friends and out of nowhere my screen went black and my GPU fans revved to what I'm going to assume was max. I could still hear sounds but had no controls and the only thing I could do was hard reboot. This happened twice last week, once on Saturday and once on Sunday, while playing the BF6 beta... I chocked it up to the game being in the beta phase since I had read about the game crashing for others as well. Except last night I hard rebooted and tried again and immediately was met with the same black screen as soon as I started the game. This happened 3 times. So I gave up and went to bed. I only have time to game on the weekends currently and during the week my PC doesn't usually get used lately.

This morning I took my pc apart to check the power connection, make sure my GPU was seated correctly in the PCI slot, even swapped the power cable with one my sons PC wasn't using. Everything seemed to be just like it was when I built it in January. Put it back together and started it up and it seemed like it took longer than usual. I also noticed that the MSI Afterburner icon was gone on my desktop. When I tried to open it, it told me that the file couldn't be located or something along those lines. Definitely didn't delete it as I was running it and Riva Tuner while playing last night. Tried to run Delta Force and it was also uninstalled. At this ppint PC started freezing and the only thing I could do was hard reboot it again. 

I took the GPU out and just used iGPU and it seemed like it started working just fine. Until it didn't... but as you know, seemingly anything failing all produces relatively the same symptoms so I decided to start trying to check things off the list. Took one stick of ram out, seemed to work better. Tested ram through Windows, no issues. Installed 2nd stick again and retested, no issues. Downloaded Memtest86 and ran 4 passes with both sticks, no errors besides noticing that the BIOS update must have reverted my ram back to 4800 rather than the 6000 it was running previously.

Last weekend I installed a Windows update and the update through Nvidia, so I went ahead and updated my BIOS cuz you know 9800X3D and Asrock motherboard. So I knew everything was up to date but I still went ahead and completely uninstalled everything Nvidia with Revo bc I could not uninstall Afterburner or Riva due to the files not being located. Reinstalled the GPU and Nvidia App and drivers. Again seemed to work okay for about an 30 minutes and as soon as I went to install Delta Force it froze again.

Did this a time or 2 and then I started getting a red light on mobo for Boot and VGA. Took graphics card out again. Even switched to a HDMI cable as that's the only extra cable I had on hand atm and it booted through once and then froze on the desktop. Now its even struggling to boot if it even willl. 

Windows says my M.2 is healthy.

Since the BF6 reveal, I've been in constant reflection about my own experiences with the IP, and been revisiting a lot of the olders games to really nail down what I'm really looking forward in Battlefield. And that's also why I'm super interested in everyone's take on the matter.

Ouuuu alors me refaire une Cfg Neuve et revendre mon PC actuel ! 



Voici la config qui me ferait envie

Vais-je réellement ressentir une difference entre un i7 13700k et un 9800x ? y a t'il un gros Gap entre ces 2 configs ( Si j'upgrade seulement la CG sur ma config actuelle )

  
A savoir que ce PC me sert principalement à jouer.

Quelques jeux en solo gourmand style Cyberpunk et surtout du jeu multi style Tarkov / BF etc

What happened?,YeahhhhhWhateverrrr,False,True,False,,False,"It was not at all uncommon to see thr sentiment of ""best cod in years"" and praising things like omni movement. If we are being honest here, its one of the best playing shooters ever made. 

Cods gameplay is always stellar quality wise, its fine if you prefer certain styles im purely talking on a technical level and polish, how all the mechanics feel to use. Does this move, this gun, this climb, all feel good and do what I expect when I expect it. There is ZERO ""realistic"", (talking not things like halo or destiny) shooters that match its quality and polish of a cod game. Even battlefield 6, a game I liked, is behind on just the basics by a lot a lot. Even things like recoil and vaulting feel off in bf6.  Quality and gameplay polish, is just something call of duty has over everyone. That doesn't mean the choices they make design wise, or money wise, are good. But raw gameplay polish and production values are factually unbeaten. Games like halo infinite and destiny 2 are the only other games that have such hyper polished gameplay. 

Omni movement is a pretty notable improvement snd innovation to basic fps gameplay. Allowing players to vary their movement speed in multiple directions, just makes sense. Like REAL people would move. We as human beings are not limited by sprinting one speed, and only forward. I think its REALLY bizzare that some people now act like omnimovement is ""less grounded and realistic"" when its objectively more realistic but I digress. Just because its not likely a soldier would dive into a room and start shooting instead of slowly peaking doorways, does not mean having that be a movement option, is unrealistic. Its the opposite.  

That being saiiiiiiddddd. Why does EVERYONE change their tune on cod by the end of its lifespan? I can understand people hating the skins. But otherwise? I dont get it. It seems UNIVERSAL for all call of duty games and has been since the orginallll mw2. 

Look, I dont like the skins and battlepasses either. And I am NOT a huge cod fan at all. Im much more into halo, always have been. Was a screw call of duty guy, when halo 3 was head to head with cod 4, waw,  and mw2. Certified cod hater. Would feel dirty as a teenager every time id play it, like I was betraying my beloved halo 3. 

But I quite like the new cods since the new mw2019. Wasn't a big fan of mw3. But black ops 6 I think is just fucking awesome to play. I adore the 90s action movie vibe and gameplay. Theres nothing cooler than diving out of a second story window and getting s kill on the way down. It FEELS incredible to pull off. It doesnt eve feel clunky, I never accidentally do a movement I dont want to do, Its great. 

So yeah, again, dont get it. ",False,/r/blackops6/comments/1mz6s4b/black_ops_6_was_loved_at_launch_and_months_after/,blackops6,1756067885.0,60,0.49,Discussion

Game was amazing at launch with few issues. Dice LA came in and changed the TTK, and from there it's a bit more controversial. Some people liked their changes, others feel they didn't need to be made. LA refined a few things and released pretty cool DLC for the most part.

I happen to think medics are too OP in both 1 and V, and that is probably the major issue nobody fixed with them. But hey they are still amazing games in the golden period of Dice. The Sweden team was so talented.

V was not great on release, with maps that just did not make sense in way too many areas. It took them ages to balance anything properly. Tanks being basically immortal really HURT the game for a long time.

The TTK is decently fast, but it's the fastest I would want out of anything with big maps. I am very good with meta weapons, but by the time I abandoned it, like 60 hours in, the game was just not great, and things were being nerfed. Now the ZH and Type 2 and other weapons are tops, and it's a new ball game for me. 

I thought BF6 was a decent beta and a game I would never buy on release. Worse than V in almost every way. The revive animations were amazing though. Yet why would I buy something like this on release? Those maps were not great. The best one, Cairo, was basically Amiens without the end zones lol. And a worse immersive experience as well with very little room to move anywhere. 

Now coming back to V, this game is still going strong on console especially. Holy shit there were over 1000 people in US servers yesterday on PS.

I booted it up on my PC too, and the graphics are definitely a little step up with DXR and ray tracing being decent on PC. Not as many people but still servers going.

The consoles sadly did not get a next gen patch, DAMN YOU EA!, but they also run really well at least. Thank god they got a PS4 Pro patch or we'd be stuck with the garbage BF4 quality that they let go to shite.

Regardless, this is the actual Battlefield game I wanted. And I really was not happy with the game on release. If only they released a few more maps for this WW2 game that doesn't feel like WW2 at all on a lot of the maps.

But it really proves just how bad the maps are on 6. Pacific Storm rolls over any map in BF6 by such large margin it's not even funny. It's sad. And I have almost no hope for 6 in the future. MAYBE a year after release it will become a decent BF that isn't chasing COD. Maybe the timeline of V will be what 6 follows, but from what we hear they plan on abandoning these games pretty fast in the future. Whatever I guess.

All the bots and AI on Reddit could not convince me to buy 6.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mz2ghm/going_back_to_bfv_is_a_much_better_experience/,Battlefield,1756058024.0,4,0.28,Battlefield V

I'm having a blast but despite having all DLC, I can hardly ever get a DLC game on any DLC maps. This is a real shame because a lot of the best maps are DLC. 

I'm guessing a lot of newer players have went to buy older BF games to try them out while they wait for BF6 but are probably put off buying the DLC since they're all still at full price despite them being around a decade old, meaning it's about $40 PER GAME for the dlc making them about $100 into total for the full experience PER GAME. 

This is prohibitively expensive and to be honest you're probably losing money from people aren't buying any of the DLC now who WOULD buy it at a significantly discounted price.

Come on guys, games that are 9, 12, 15 years old should not be this expensive and are probably losing you money in this crucial time where people are hungry for more of the Battlefield experience.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mz27qe/ea_please_put_older_bf_games_dlc_on_sale/,Battlefield,1756057489.0,4,1.0,Discussion

The difference is significant. Colors are vibrant and pop, and map looks more lively and close to what real life would look like. I can only imagine how much no filter would improve player visibility. We essentially have a color overlay over the entire screen, muting the beauty behind.. of the distinct colors.

Default filter should be toned down, or rather give us the option to remove the filter.

1myx23q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1myx23q/recon_should_be_reconfigured_to_use_dmrs_as_their/,,0,"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers",Kothre,1756046567.0,True,False,,False,"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.

For basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.

Here’s why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:

* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It’s frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.
* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That’s why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It’s not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it’s the only way they can “balance” sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. 
* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads—covering the 300–600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.
* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they’re not every squad—they’re specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they’d work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.
* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.
* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won’t be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.

Battlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I’m fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.

Ich möchte gerne BF6 in sehr hohen Einstellungen bei WQHD spielen können. Außerdem soll der PC gelegentlich für Bildbearbeitung (insbesondere RAW-Bilder in Lightroom) genutzt werden und insgesamt zukunftssicher aufgestellt sein.

The song that played while loading MAC maps. And I was wondering and an Idea came to my mind. What if bf developers remasterd some OG maps from Battlefield 2 and put it in bf6.

I would personally be glad for Strike at Karkand, because that is a beautiful city map with few vehicles and a lot of infantry. The destruction there would be also stunning. I remember this was the most played map. Even now if you play on fan servers, it is still the most played map. 

Also Road to Jalalabad would be perfect fit in bf6 gameplay and maybe some chinese maps to have something different than just urban and desert maps.

I am a medic main, and I care about Revives more than I care about kills.  my goal every round is to lead both teams in revives.  you might be surprised by how many times I've led all scorers while going 9-and-10.

i noticed that at the end of a round in BF6, the only time the game told me how many revives I'd gotten was when I'd set a new personal best.  (presumably, if I also set a new personal best in kills during that same round, for example, the game might choose to display _that_, instead.)

during post-round, you get the little icon squares that display score, kills, deaths, and assists... **could we add an icon square for Revives, as well?**

&nbsp; 

PTFO and revivng allies are two of the things that make the Battlefield series unique; as such, we should _never_ end a round without knowing how many caps and revives we notched!

I’ve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).

After BO6, which I didn’t enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I’m well aware those trailers don’t necessarily reflect the multiplayer.

Yesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.

My takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn’t fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).
I loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it’s supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we’re getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay—and so much fun.

So, I’m optimistic, but of course I’ll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let’s hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins).

Imagine a scenario where someone blows up a house. As an engineer, you go in and quickly build up some sandbag walls so your teammates can use them as cover.

So much praise for the game recently and I was like ""do we play the same game, especially after the BF6 beta?""

Maps are fucking horrendous. So many of them are literally just barren, empty spaces, even the smaller 64 player versions. Especially the desert maps like Hourglass, El Alamein and Discarded. There is ZERO cover between capture points.

And this leads me to my next point: The TOR tank. Yep, this thing, depsite its ""nerf"", is game breaking in my opinion. Not only is it a shit concept, but it's also frustrating. You want to transport people with your MAV or Brawler around? Good luck with a TOR camping on a hill on El Alamein overlooking the entire map. Yep, I got killed multiple times over the weekend by these players. And the best thing is, they don't even have to leave their safe space aka the HQ, so not much you can do. Helicopter? Forget it, a Wildcat is sitting right next to it and some dudes as well who repair both. Peak gameplay.

  
Also so many other garbage concepts like Liz with her stupid TV missile, often getting kills without even needing line of sight. Wonderful.

Nah man, don't let people tell you this is a ""good game"" by now. **It is a fixed, functional game**. But a garbage game nontheless.

Follow these steps to get your rewards!",Burkely31,False,True,False,,False,"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25



So, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.

  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)

  
At the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. ""How to Unbind My Account"" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted ""mess"" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to ""connections"" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. 

  
  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. 

  
  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my ""own"" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to ""Delta Force App"". 

  
  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***

*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***
*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.
*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has ""Drops Enabled"". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.
*  
*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see ""**Delta Force App"". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** 

*   \*\*\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on ""Connect"" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces ""Level Infitite"" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \*\*\*\*\*
* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the ""Login with email and password"" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!
*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click ""Connect"" or you can likely just click on ""Claim"" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \*\*\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on ""Step #2"" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the ""Delta Force App"" to your account. Accept that.
*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click ""claim"" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. 
*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and ""Claim"" the rewards!**

  
   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!

I don’t want the game to feel like just another generic realistic FPS shooter. I want it to feel like Battlefield 6.

Same thing with BF3. It might not look realistic in terms of color grading, but it feels like BF3. Every time I come back to it, I get the same feeling I had when I first played it all those years ago.

Nowadays, everything has to look as realistic as possible and honestly, I think that sucks the soul out of a lot of games and movies. It all starts to blur together. The BF6 filters give the game style, identity, and atmosphere. I’d rather have a game with a strong visual direction than one that looks like a tech demo.

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof. Hope to hear from you soon! :)",False,/r/GamerPals/comments/1mypqw2/28m_est_pc_recently_divorced_and_need_a/,GamerPals,1756022463.0,5,0.56,North America

Probably the biggest fan of the OG stuff. I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.

- ""Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone"".

Yet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.

- ""Why would I not use armor, thats stupid""

You're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.

- ""You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless"".

Fair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.

- ""Weapon rarity sucks"".

No it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.

- ""BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists"".

The fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.

- ""Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6""

Okay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?

These aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment.

In Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it’s so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. 

Sadly, I don’t see this changing too much at this point because it’s a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can’t be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don’t have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You’d only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.

This approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

What bothers me most is the map design in the game.  
It's either open plains with very little cover, through which you have to run for hundreds of meters on foot to get to the next objective (because simple transport vehicles like jeeps, quads and dirtbikes are in short supply for some reason, despite the maps being huge) - this makes you just a sitting duck for snipers and vehicles or everyone who sees you and you can be shot from either direction... and why is the terrain so flat and open on so many maps? 

Or it's the other extreme, narrow corridors where both teams end in a stalemate, spam smokes and explosives and when you try to push through, you have 10 guns pointed at you and you immediately die.

The game looks very crispy, you know the textures are on point, the animations are gorgeous, but the visual clarity of ALL of that goes down the gutter on all the maps I played in the Beta because of the aggressive filters over them all. Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.

I'm eagerly awaiting BF6 however I saw the trailer for HLLV pop up on my feed and it looks awesome. The environment, theme, vehicles and weapons look very fun.

I know nothing about HLL whatsoever but I was thinking I might get HLLV and play it alongside BF6.

So, how does a typical HLL round play out? What sort of weapons are mainly used? I understand it's more of a milsim so I'm assuming it's generally a 1-2 shot kill and guns are almost always used in semi auto? How do the game modes work? Are tanks etc. very strong?

What sort of things should I keep in mind coming from Battlefield? 

I'm very keen to give this game a go.

MGS Delta sai logo logo e já temos benchmarks ruins do game. Sofrendo pra rodar em ótimas GPUs (tipo a RTX 4060) e nos consoles de mesa (PS5 e PS5 PRO). Esse era um dos jogos que eu tava mais hypando pra jogar no lançamento e agora toda a vontade se foi por causa da preguiça crônica do desenvolvedor de querer otimizar o jogo corretamente. 

Outros exemplos: TESIV Oblivion Remastered. Como já podem ver pela minha flair, meu hardware, sim, é de entrada, especialmente em 2025. Porém, consigo rodar muitos jogos em qualidade alta sem suar. Red Dead 2, RE4 Remake (naquele preset priorizar qualidade), AC Mirage, BF6, entre outros. TODOS ESSES graficamente muito mais impressionantes que Oblivion. E ainda assim, depois de 4 meses de lançamento, o jogo continua injogável na minha máquina. Engasgos, ghosting, input lag, bugs que quebram o jogo, etc. Este era o jogo que eu mais queria jogar esse ano.

Aí que eu me pergunto: em que momento se tornou aceitável pagar 70 dólares em jogos incompletos? Em que momento ficamos de cabeça abaixada pra desenvolvedoras que não tem a mínima vontade de ao menos trabalhar em fazer pelo menos os reflexos da água, vidro etc sem recorrer ao Ray Tracing, que, apesar de impressionante visualmente, é inviável pra 70, 80% dos jogadores de PC? 

É ultrajante, no mínimo.

(aos que vão comentar logo, sim, eu entendo que a UE5 é muito acessível pra estúdios menores e que vai ser o padrão da indústria logo. Mas peguem Expedition 33 como um exemplo. Aquilo é jogo bonito e otimizado de maneira decente.)

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.

I know that there are ""night"" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?

The only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this. Idk, seems like a cool experience the devs could create, and I haven't really seen this in any other multiplayer game, except maybe Tarkov but that's almost an other genre.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myjik1/are_we_ever_gonna_get_an_actual_night_map/,Battlefield,1756000927.0,9,0.57,Discussion
