Been trying to catch that old vibe of gaming while also building a lil community of like minded gamers. Don’t need any fancy equipment or to any chats just need to play the game fr lol. I’m on PC but play and open to any crossplay games currently i have  Warzone , Abyssus , Rivals , Delta force & madden 26 in my rotation & will be on BF6 & Borderlands 2 but I play pretty much everything.

https://i.redd.it/r0tujncwzmkf1.gif

Please devs, bring gyro/motion aiming to the PS5 version.

For those who don’t know Gyro aiming = Aiming by moving your controller. I recommend looking it up and watching experienced players using it.

It is a great input method for shooters + other types of games which require aiming. Remember that having gyro support ≠ you are forced to use it.

# Reasons to have gyro aim

* More accurate than sticks (Since you can use your wrist, not just your thumb)
* Doesn’t need any aim assist
* Makes the game more accessible and fair (especially with crossplay)
* Parity between other games —> makes it easier to jump between games since they support the same input methods (List below)
* Makes the aiming more rewarding and fun since you are doing the aiming
* industry will progress away from stick only AA aiming
* ~~Actually be ahead of Battlefield franchise :P~~ Too late, there will be gyro aiming in BF6

# Some games that already support Gyro aiming.

* Battlefield 6
* CoD MW2
* CoD MW3
* CoD BO6
* Fortnite
* The Finals
* Deathloop
* No Mans Sky
* Helldivers 2
* GoW Ragnarök
* Most other Playstation 1st party games
* Most Shooter Games on Switch (Doom, Apex, Overwatch, Portal 1&2, Borderlands…)

Which backups our claims. Changes wouldn't need to be made if it was ""fine the way it was"" as some of you claimed.

I'm so sick of hearing that we shouldn't be comparing BF6 to previous BF games or COD games for how the game should be played. It is a BF game, not a COD game and BF fans like myself can see that from first hand experience when we played the BF6 beta and we used our experience from previous BF games to express our complaints and that is for good reason.

We have valid complaints and because our complaints things are being done about it and changes are being made. You are welcome.

Let the BF fans lead the way, you COD players just sit back, wait for good changes to come based on our feedback and enjoy a good game. We got this.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mxefzt/bf6_comparison_to_that_other_game/,Battlefield,1755887429.0,11,0.5,Discussion

bei der BF6 Beta ist mal wieder aufgefallen, dass mein Rechner etwas in die Jahre gekommen ist. Vor allem die CPU hat den Spielspaß bei Zeiten ordentlich beeinträchtigt. Deshalb überlege ich nun meinem Rechner auf AM4-Basis noch ein Paar letzte Upgrades zu gönnen. Da die CPUs nach und nach Richtung EOL gehen und vom Markt verschwinden wäre dies das akuteste Upgrade. Leider bin ich wohl zu Spät was einen 5800X3D angeht und auch der 5700X3D steigt gerade heftig im Preis. 

Nun zur Frage: Würdet ihr den 5700X3D für knapp 300€ kaufen oder doch eher auf einen 5800X/5900X/5950 ausweichen? Diese sind zum Teil deutlich günstiger zu haben.

Eine neue Grafikkarte kommt Ende des Jahres so oder so.

Beim Ram überlege ich auch noch kurzfristig auf mindestens 32 GB umzusteigen.

I got hyped on BF6 beta and decided to try 2042 while it's on sale. But I just can't play it. I get into main menu and then in like from 10 seconds to a couple minutes I get disconnected. Googling error codes doesn't give any info. Trying solutions from similar problems with different error codes doesn't help either. 

  
I had disconnects in BF6 similar to this, but they fixed themselves somehow after a couple re-logins. I don't have any connectivity issues in BF1 or any other game.

  
I'm on pc, win10. Here's what I tried:

1) Check integrity of the game (through steam)

2) Re-install the game

3) Network reset in windows

4) Using VPNs

5) Turning my router off/on, as well as my pc of course

1mxdcqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1mxdcqd/cod_explanatory_post_about_the_tpm_20_problem_in/,,9,[COD] Explanatory post about the TPM 2.0 problem in CoD/Warzone - Learn how to solve it,pgdm1997,False,True,False,,False,"I’d like to share my recent experience with **TPM 2.0**, operating system updates, configurations, and ASRock’s customer support.

As many of you know — and as has been widely reported in recent days — **Call of Duty** has been showing an informational message saying that **TPM 2.0 is not active**, even though it actually is (and most likely is, since it has been a standard for years now).

After a lot of troubleshooting, reading various articles, and even going through Activision’s own guides ([link here](https://support.activision.com/br/pt/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot)), I finally figured out the issue.

Based on AMD’s **PA-420** article ([link here](https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/pa-420.html)), the problem comes from a **vulnerability acknowledged by AMD around two years ago**, affecting **Ryzen CPUs up to the 5000 series**.  
The fix was left as **OPTIONAL for motherboard manufacturers** — which I personally find absurd. Because of that, the TPM firmware remains on a version that doesn’t prevent the device from working, but **it can fail attestation**, which is what Ricochet (the anti-cheat) seems to be checking.

# What actually happens?

I’ve seen people reporting that the game still runs fine despite the warning (that was my case too), but there are also reports of:

* Players being **unable to find matches**
* Players being **kicked out right after the match starts**

# How to check your TPM version?

1. Press **Windows + R**
2. Type **tpm.msc** and hit **Enter**
3. If your TPM version is [**3.92.0.5**](http://3.92.0.5) **or lower**, don’t panic:
   * It’s a **local vulnerability**, your PC is not exposed.
   * This is probably why AMD made the fix optional.

Activision recommends contacting your **motherboard manufacturer** for update instructions, which is exactly what I did.

# How I fixed it

I submitted a ticket to **ASRock Brazil support**, and yesterday they sent me a **BIOS version (5.67)** that includes the fix, updating my TPM 2.0 to **version 3.94.2.5**.  
Unfortunately, this version is **not yet available on their website**, so the only way to get it is by contacting support.

As for other brands:

* **MSI** is aware of the issue, but it’s not a priority for them, and they don’t seem to provide a BIOS file with the fix directly.
* **Gigabyte** apparently has already released BIOS updates with this fix in previous versions.
* I haven’t found info on other manufacturers yet.

# What might happen next?

After this one-week saga, I see three possible scenarios:

1. **Activision relaxes the Ricochet TPM check**, like BF6, which only requires TPM 2.0 to exist but doesn’t care about the version.
2. **Motherboard manufacturers release the fix publicly**, as support requests increase.
3. **People will need to upgrade hardware** if the fix isn’t provided — although this is the least likely scenario, since most players won’t go through this level of research and troubleshooting.

1mxd7nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/codbr/comments/1mxd7nx/post_elucidativo_sobre_os_problemas_de_tpm_20_no/,,1,POST ELUCIDATIVO SOBRE OS PROBLEMAS DE TPM 2.0 NO COD/WARZONE - SAIBA COMO RESOLVER,pgdm1997,False,True,False,,False,"Venho por meio deste texto compartilhar minha recente experiência com o TPM 2.0, atualizações de sistema operacional, configurações, e suporte ao cliente da marca ASRock. Como muitos sabem, e vem reportando nos últimos dias, o CoD vem emitindo uma mensagem informativa para os jogadores dizendo que o TPM 2.0 não está ativo, mesmo que já esteja (e muito provavelmente está, pois é um padrão já tem uns anos). Depois de quebrar muito a cabeça, procurar outros artigos, e ler até mesmo os guias da própria Activision (https://support.activision.com/br/pt/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot), encontrei o problema. Com base no artigo PA-420 da própria AMD (https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/faqs/pa-420.html), o problema do TPM se dá por uma vulnerabilidade já reconhecida há cerca de dois anos pela fabricante, afetando os Ryzen até a série 5000, este fix que foi deixado como OPCIONAL aos fabricantes de placas-mãe, o que eu pelo menos acho um absurdo, e faz com que o TPM fique em uma versão de firmware que não impede o dispositivo de funcionar, mas pode falhar o ""attestation"", que é o que o Ricochet parece estar identificando. 



Tenho visto algumas pessoas reportando que o jogo continua funcionando normalmente, mesmo com a mensagem, o que também era o meu caso, mas também vi relatos onde o jogo estava impedindo os jogadores de encontrar partidas, ou os removendo assim que a partida começava. Então vamos à como resolvi meu problema. Se você executar o ""tpm.msc"" no Windows + R, e sua versão do TPM for 3.92.0.5 ou abaixo, não se assuste, pois é uma vulnerabilidade LOCAL, e seu PC não estará exposto, provavelmente por isso a AMD permitiu que o fix fosse opcional. Sendo assim, a recomendação da Activision é que entremos em contato com o fabricante da placa-mãe para obter informações sobre atualização e correção, e foi o que eu fiz. Submeti um ticket ao suporte brasileiro da ASRock, e ontem me enviaram uma versão de BIOS que tem a correção (5.67 que fez meu TPM 2.0 subir para a versão 3.94.2.5), uma versão que infelizmente ainda não está no site deles, então a única forma de obter, é via contato com suporte. Encontrei artigos dizendo que a MSI sabe do problema também, mas não é prioridade no fix e não parecem provisionar o arquivo de BIOS com o fix diretamente. Gigabyte aparentemente já soltou esse fix em BIOS anteriores. Não encontrei informações de outros fabricantes até o momento.



Depois de toda essa saga de mais de uma semana, penso em 3 possíveis alternativas e resultados para esse problema: 1 - A Activision afrouxa as rédeas de como o Ricochet identifica o TPM 2.0, como no BF6, que também pede que o TPM 2.0 exista mas ignora a versão; 2 - Os fabricantes de placas soltam o fix, pois o número de chamados deve aumentar; 3 - As pessoas terão que fazer upgrade de peças, caso o fix não seja liberado. Essa última opção é a menos provável, pois poucas pessoas tem a disposição de correr atrás e pesquisar dessa forma, o que afasta uma parcela considerável de pessoas que jogam no PC atualmente.

What I don’t like in BF1

	•	Respawns are too far from the objectives – every death feels like a marathon just to reach the objective.

	•	TTK feels too long – assault rifles need like 6–7 bullets to kill, and most of the time enemies just prone behind cover before going down.

	•	Snipers dominate – with the wide open maps and weak assaults, they feel way too powerful.

	•	Healing is slow – unless a medic is on you, you’re waiting ages to recover.

What I do like in BF1

	•	Unique weapon feel – every gun has character, nothing feels like a copy-paste.

	•	Operations mode – still the best large-scale Battlefield mode ever, with that push-and-pull frontline.

	•	Map design – visually stunning, and trenches/cover actually matter in firefights.


BF1 Overall

It feels slow. After 10 deaths I was already getting frustrated, because it takes too long to get back into the fight and usually ends with getting picked off by a sniper or someone hiding in the grass.

Compared to Battlefield 6 Beta

The BF6 beta felt much quicker and more responsive.

	•	Respawns put you back into combat faster

	•	Movement feels smoother and more fluid although I’m happy the bunny hoping would be fixed.

	•	Assault rifles feel strong again, so pushing objectives is actually fun and you can enter and get 2-3 kills on a single mag

	•	Snipers are still strong, but not nearly as oppressive as in BF1

Final Thoughts

BF1 has the atmosphere, beautiful maps, and Operations (which is still unmatched). But BF6 beta felt way better for shorter, high-energy sessions where you just want to spawn, fight, and stay in the action.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mxc9ui/just_played_bf1_after_bf6_my_two_cents/,Battlefield,1755882529.0,5,0.17,Battlefield 1

I played BF4 back in 2016 on PS4 and thought it was okay, but BF6 on PC is so nice.

My questions is, the BF6 skins BP on BF2042, is that cross-save? I ask becuase BF2042 is free on PS+ and I am cheap lol, I dont want to spend 3 dollars if I dont have too nor do I want to install the EA app.

Battlefield 6 beta went out, big fan of bf saga and i couldn't spectate that, so i still played the beta horribly honestly and now im about to cope this pc.  
  
the new specs: intel Core i7-14700 - B760M-A AX6 II - 16GB DDR5 5600Mhz Kingston Fury Beast XMP - 1TB M.2 Kingston SNV3S/1000G NVMe PCIe Gen 4.0 - Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB GDDR6, Asus Prime (i have doubts with this GPU.) - 650W 80 Plus Silver, Gigabyte ICE - Cooler Master ML240 Illusion ARGB

That pc with a Antec CX600M Trio White, 3xFan.. it's pretty and also like 1800usd. (im from chile so that would be likely the conversion.)

What could you say about those specs? it would be good? for how many years? BF6 would be playable atleast in mid?   
Im not a hardcore player, i use the pc just for discord and games with friends, maybe forza horizon 5... with this new pc i would love to play stalker 2 because my actual one didn't run well..

I’m not sure if it’s a skill issue or if they just feel underpowered. For example, the IFV’s cannon feels like it has no projectile velocity and drops instantly, as well as no explosive damage. It does one-shot on direct hits, but I feel as if this shouldn’t be the role of a vehicle. It feels almost like I’m playing recon to me except my bullets drop after 100 ft. The MBT isn’t so bad, the cannon seems to have decent splash (albeit still lack luster to me, but it’s not bad). Vehicle responsiveness and movement controls are ok I suppose. 

Overall the ground vehicle experience to me just screams lackluster, but I see almost no one talking about in the community whether laypeople or high profile community members, and I’m curious if I’m alone on this. 

I’m not making this post here to make a claim about whether they need to be buffed or nerfed, more-so gather community sentiment about how ground vehicles play since I’m seeing no one else talk about it.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mxbr58/thoughts_on_bf6_ground_vehicles/,Battlefield,1755881360.0,9,0.72,Battlefield 6

Short summery:

I enabled secureboot and pc was booting fine, I then cleaned it with a hairdryer (as I have done many times without problems whatsoever) and then it wasn't booting at all. No post screen, no beeps- nothing!

At that point I really thought I fried my motherboard because of the hairdryer. But reading some posts about secureboot fucking up Gigabyte boards has lead me to think that perhaps this was the problem.

Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 7 5700X

MB: Gigabyte B450M DS3H

RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3200MHZ 8GBx4

GPU: Gigabyte RTX 2060

PSU: Antec 650W

What I've tried:

Resetting CMOS

Different GPU, CPU

Removing and reseating RAM (Even without any RAM sticks it wasn't even giving me any beeps)

At that point I was ready to throw the towel and get another motherboard, but I read that some users have tried booting with CPU internal graphics with some success. Since I didn't have an am4 CPU with integrated graphics I decided that getting a cheap Athlon 200GE would be worth the shot since it was cheaper than a new MB. Placed an order for 20$ and waited a while.

Today I got it from the mail and threw it in my MB- AND IT FUCKING WORKS! So baffling. I really thought this MB was toast. I was getting nothing! No beeps, no screen output.

Next thing was to reflash the bios through uefi (my motherboard doesn't have a qflash button, and I wasn't even getting it to post) and than switching to my 5700X and booting and everything works as before.

My guess is that enabling secureboot somehow overrides the GPU. No idea

I'm writing this because this is such an obscure problem that have come up with the recent BF6 beta needing the have secureboot enabled, and I hope this is helpful to anyone having this problem as well.

Hoping i could get some help from the people at bapccanada! Friend and I mostly play the same stuff and we work at the same company so this advice will help 2 people :)

  
Looking to build a PC in the upcoming weeks for gaming but also for work. Games we'll play range from the upcoming BF6 to League of Legends, to indie games for fun. Looking for 1440p gaming. Personally have 3 monitors (1 UW 34'', 2x 27'', all 1440p) and friend has 2 monitors (UW 34'' and 1x 27'', both 1440p).

For work, we mainly use the M365 suite, bunch of adobe PDF, browser tabs and excel files open. Outlook and teams for voice / video call is a must. I personally like to fool around with fusion 360 and my 3d printer, VMs and whatnot, but those are very occasional so not critical.

Budget would be 2750 to 3000 for a mid-tower from scratch. We both work for a VAR so we have access to a lot of parts for cost instead of retail pricing. Some stuff is still better at a retail store since company is more enterprise focused so stuff like GPUs can be cheaper (i.e. the 5070ti in the config below can be had for 1031$, and an asus prime 5080 would be 1348) but other more consumer parts are usually more expensive (case, PSU, mobo...).

I like to still be able to upgrade in the future (storage, possibly upgrading the GPU in a couple years or so).

 

With context established, here's my questions:

* We've pretty much decided that AMD and a 5070ti would be a sweet spot but we're still checking if a 5080 could fit in the budget - I've put together this config so far - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2)

* we're very much undecided between 9800x3d, 9900x or 9700x. so far, the below is my understanding so please correct me if i am wrong (All MSRP price):

*  

   * 9800x3d - \~689$, gaming king but I also work from my desktop and those CPU are kinda meh for multitasking... Not sure how BAD they would be for my use case though...

   * 9900x - \~649$ 12 cores, 24 threads, great for multitasking, sometimes worst than a 9700x for gaming because of 2 CCDs and core parking being spotty with AMD...

   * 9700x - \~520$ - better performance in some games than the 9900x, ok multitasking but is essentially an 9800X3D without the cache.

* On one hand, I want to go 9800x3d but can't find any clear picture on how much worst it would be at work related stuff. I can't imagine it would be THAT bad but all I read is ""it sucks for work tasks"" but no clear comparison. The 9900x seems like a good deal with the sales going on right now but... feels like a bad deal compared to the 9700x... The 9700x seems great but then you're so close to just having a juggernaut for gaming for just a bit more with the 9800x3d.

* I've also been looking at the 265k from intel but value prop seems to just not be there... specially in an architecture that will not be supported long term. AM5/ZEN 5 was already confirmed to stay the standard until at least 2027, possibly beyond.

Hey all, I am buying a 5070Ti for my PC. I like playing AAA games and FPS games at 1440p. I’m currently torn on whether or not I should upgrade to AM5 or keep what I have on AM4. I know that I’ll need to probably upgrade the processor and of course PSU (850w?). What do you all suggest? I have a mini itx so having to shell out a lot of extra money on a full upgrade for AM5 isn’t really appealing but I also don’t want to totally limit my 5070Ti. Just didn’t like the frames I was getting with my 3060Ti in COD and BF6. Thanks in advance!

1mx8u8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx8u8h/fun_conspiracy_theory_wip_bf56_classes_are/,,0,Fun conspiracy theory (WIP): BF56 classes are inspired by most played BF2042 specialists,GerhardKoepke,False,True,False,,False,"**Listen, this is probably a brain fart, so don't get all riled up but rather join the fun conspiracy theorizing. :D**

I was thinking about what impact the BF2042 specialists might have had in deciding what the classes in BF6 can and can't do. What were the most played specialists and how were they played? I don't really have this info, with the exception of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/14azz1t/falk_most_played_specialist_and_some_other_stats/) stat from 2 years ago, where Falck is the most played specialist, but assault is the most played ""class"".

So I just took the liberty and came up with my theory of of thin air, supported by playing this damn game since launch (rank S205 as of right now):

**BF6 Assault**

*Most likely inspired by:* Sundance and Mackay

*Reasoning:* Sundance is probably a really popular specialists in general, but probably one of the two most picked assaults, due to their explosive capabilities (and the wingsuit, sure). Smart grenades, normal grenades, grenade launcher - you could have it all. And the assault class has the epi pen as well. Mackay is a fan favourite due to his grapple hook, getting him access to places and angles they are not expected - Sundance can do similar things with their wing suit of course. And by using any weapon and also the plus system, high skilled players can probably react to so many different situations at a push of a button (not me, though).

*Effect on BF6:* Grenade launchers, grenades, two primary weapons (maybe with underbarrel grenade launchers in the future), the epi pen thing and soon a ladder to reach places you are not expected. What shall I say more?



**BF6 Engineer**

*Most likely inspired by:* Crawford (?!)

*Reasoning:* I think Boris is probably played more, due to the auto-aim and auto-spot turret, but something like this is (so far) not part of BF6, I chose Crawford, but only because he is able to carry 1 additional rocket. Maybe someone else has a better theory.

*Effect on BF6:* In the beta, we were starting with 5 RPGs (maybe even stingers, but I am not positive on that one). But I think the overall effect was not that big, as engineers are a well defined role anyway. 



**BF6 Support**

*Most likely inspired by:* Falck (duh!)

*Reasoning:* Falck is THE self-sufficiant hero character and probably still the most played specialist in BF2042 - she is my main and not only because I am German as well. Reviving everyone from your team, healing yourself and others and dropping ammo as well - if that isn't the support class in BF6?! She was actually what made me think of this ridiculous theory. :D

*Effect on BF6:* Unlike in former (non-2042) Battlefield titles, where you were either supplying ammo OR health depending on the class you chose, you can now supply all of it with one big old bag. Yes, this big old bag is pretty much Falck (sorry Falck...you old bag).

  
**BF6 Recon**

*Most likely inspired by:* Casper and maybe Paik

*Reasoning:* Casper has his drone he can use to spot players and put C5 on and we've already seen one in the BF6 multiplayer trailer. But more importantly, Casper and Paik both have fairly similar traits with the proximity sensor and the wall hack - you can (in theory) find and kill unobservant players.

*Effect on BF6:* I would not be surprised if something similar to the proximity sensor or wall hack thing will be introduced. DICE already said, they want the recon to be the silent killer (additionally to the reconnaissance): being behind enemy lines, being aware of them at all times and killing them unnoticed - sounds like a constant spot or proximity sensor/wall hack would fit right in (I hope not, though). In the beta, you were already 3D spotted by anyone looking in your general direction and auto-spotted by recons just aiming at you. By enabling the compass, you would also see the spotted enemies relative to your direction. It's just a small step to the proximity sensor then. Maybe this will be limited to and/or even enhanced for the recon (e.g. showing the rough direction of unspotted enemies nearby, like in Battlefront). Together with the normal drone we've seen in the trailer and the UAV, which is just an auto-spotting drone anyway, the recon would be a walking motion sensor ball.  
Personally, I'm not sure what this means to the classic recon with a sniper rifle, if you are encouraged to get up close and personal all the time. And then you don't even have a respawn beacon.

Indie devs face their own issues and are just in a different ball park for me

Anyways prime examples for me: wildgate and BF6

Both had pretty great reception, but because of the price barrier the player counts will absolutely remain lower than what they should be at. Add in that you need to not only pay to buy the game, but then your paying for cosmetics on top of that, as well as time gating weapons and skills that people wanna use straight away to make the overall experience better

Anyways devs seem to have their head in their asses in general right now, being greedy enough to sell skins after the initial purchase is bonkers, what happened to FTP, then buy the skins? Not buy the game, and then the skins too. If I'm buying the game I sure as shit better earn the skins in game too

Anyways, simple ways to launch this game into the stratosphere:

1. FTP model, pay for hero skins, pay for hideout skins. Look at league and Dota, FTP moba's that have stood the test of time with this exact model

2. Different ques: casuals want to play against casuals and sweats wanna sweat with other sweats. Que time doesn't matter unless it's 5+ minutes, just give quality matches. Obviously the playtest can be different, but I think they should lean into it when the game gets released

Dark and darker is a great example of why casual and competitive cannot mix together. The skill difference is one thing, but to add in knowledge gaps on top of it makes the mix ques just no fun for anyone. Noobs need a place to learn PvP, casual ques are that mid ground before competitive but harder than playing against bots

That's basically it, a FTP model is honestly all that's needed and I think this game would get the traffic easily. Add in the paid cosmetics and there's your profit, make it so you can also earn the skins in game over a decent grind (league does it well) and you're absolutely cooking

BF2042 isn't terrible when I started playing it as it is, rather than thinking about what it isn't.

The Iwo Jima map is insanely good. I have never been a huge vehicle user, so the idea of a map with little building coverage never really interested me, but the immersion that vehicles bring is amazing. I started tank hunting and man is that satisfying when you C4 one, or get the last hit with a rocket launcher. Helicopters flying overhead, crashing, the jets swooping low, the whole thing is very good.

With that being said: The BF6 Beta

I really enjoyed the beta, I love the close quarters combat that we got from it, Cairo was my favorite map and the only one that really had like a ""modern"" taste to it. I've played Squad and there's something cool about running around Fallujah-ish type maps. 

I'm ok with smaller maps - but I now do think it needs more vehicles and to be a bit larger + bigger lobbies.

Visually speaking - as a ground soldier, witnessing helicopters flying overhead, crashing into those tall buildings, the destruction. Running out from a small alley with a tank or two patrolling the streets puts you in situations you don't otherwise get in any other game. **This is what it was missing.**

I think stat-worrying has put a stumbling block in the minds of gamers. People who want a good KD and not die constantly to someone who is very efficient in flying a helicopter, or a tank around every corner, are missing out on the situational challenge that BF games produces. Games are supposed to be FUN. I know that term is different for everyone, but to me the more insane challenges I come across the better.

If I need to get to Objective A and there are two tanks patrolling the streets and I somehow need to get past them, that brings an aspect of situational strategy that is fun. If I die, ok? I'll respawn and try again. I'll do something different, maybe now instead of trying to get by I'll try to blow them up.

On another note - I think class system needs to be locked 100%. I don't think I need to elaborate more on that.

Idk just my thoughts. I want immersion, action movie scenarios, and to just have fun",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx72ni/a_battlefield_vet_take_on_bf2042_and_bf6/,Battlefield,1755870622.0,1,0.33,Battlefield 6

I'm on the path of building my 3rd custom pc build. I'd like the community advice on my component choices.

I'm aiming for a premium build mostly intended for gaming at 1440p 165hz on modern titles (bf6,gta6). I'd like this build to last at least 5 to 7 years. 

AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D;
Asus ROG Strix B650E-E;

Asus TUF RTX 5080 Gaming OC;
Corsaire ICUE Link TITAN 360 RX RGB;

Corsair RM1000x Shift 80 plus Gold;

I haven't choose a case yet. I'm esitating between Corsair ICUE 5000X/D RGB or a Frame 5000D RS RGB

I might also wait for the 5080 Super to come out.

What do you think ?

Games : Arma Series and upcoming Arma 4,BF6, CS, Valorant, FC26, F1 Game, AC EVO, Gta6 (maybe), trying some heavy games on graphics in the future

Budget : 1300€ +200 on monitor
Cpu : Ryzen
Gpu : Nvidia
Gpu has to be stronger then CPU

Personally not to much into graphics, I can play medium to high, im not looking into 4k and very ultra graphics, the main thing is for playing games with at least medium graphics in the near future, (focus on Arma4 main game)

1mx69el,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx69el/hot_take_only_recons_should_be_able_to_spot/,,7,HOT TAKE: Only Recons Should Be Able To Spot,CenturionB2,1755869348.0,True,False,,False,"# 1) Feels Bad, Man

You ever get the feeling when you were playing the BF6 beta that you were just glancing between looking at your screen for red diamonds and then at your mini map for more red diamonds instead of actually interacting with the environment? Like the beautifully designed and immersively rendered maps were just a pretty backdrop for an abstracted game of Space Invaders with you moving your yellow dot around a load red, blue and green dots? Did you ever feel like you couldn't break cover or try to flank because the second you did you'd appear as a bright red diamond on the screens of 20 enemy players saying ""Hey! Shoot me!""? Did all this leave you feeling tense, fatigued and unsatisfied with the game? Despite it being an overall great experience there was just something... off. I think I may have part of the reason why. And if you'll stick with me, also a potential solution.

# 2) The Problem

I'm of the opinion that the ubiquity and ease of the team spotting and auto-spotting mechanics detract from the potentially rich, immertive and engrossing design of not just BF6 but almost all modern BF games. I'd go further and say that the games need \*waaaaaay\* less intrusive HUD in general but that's a whole extra convo.

In addition to this, for years (decades) now we've all been aware of how the Recon/Scout class seems like the odd one out. It doesn't really fit neatly into the integrated teamwork jigsaw that Dice aims to create. They don't really have anything unique to contribute to the team effort.

In BF6: Assaults are front-line powerhouses, far more capable of breaking enemy lines than the other classes; Engineers are extremely capable at keeping friendly vehicles in the fight and are by far the best class for taking down heavily armoured enemy vehicles when dismounted; Only Supports are capable of healing and resupplying entire choke points and supporting infantry breakthroughs with rapid revives. Recons..? Well they can auto-spot but that's only marginally better than spamming Q, which everyone can do. The respawn beacon is useful but again it's just a slight extension of squad or vehicle respawning. Long range kills are great but it's probably easier and more efficient to pick assault and get up close and personal if you just want to get kills. The only thing they're reliably useful for is countering other Recons.

# 3) Recon Resentment

This design leads directly to the widespread feeling among players that Recons don't really contribute to the team effort and are just out for their own selfish aggrandisement getting 500 metre snipes from across the map sitting just in front of their own spawn beacon that's literally miles from any objective.

# 4) The Solution

Hence I propose that \*ONLY\* the Recon class should be able to Spot and that they should be given a big points incentive to do so, say 25 or even 50 points per spot and another 100 if that spot leads to a kill by a team mate with the usual +25% bonus for a squad assist (or something like that). This would shift the points incentive for Recons away from long distance kills and to.. you know... ACTUAL RECONNAISSANCE!

Just like in real life: Intelligence, Survailance and Reconnaissance are absolutely vital components of winning firefights, battles, operations and wars. A lack of good intelligence can stop whole offensives in their tracks. Or if they do go ahead, poor intel can lead to unmitigated disaster. Because of this front line reconnaissance units are often extremely highly respected among the ranks. The contribution they make to the team effort is invaluable and essential to the success rest of the force.

Back to Battlefield. A good Recon, unseen and off to the side, overseeing an objective, chokepoint or key area, pointing out unseen enemies, approaching vehicles and well laid traps \*as well as\* taking out well concealed and protected enemies should be able to make the difference between a successful push and a failed meatgrinder.

AND they should be rewarded for doing this! I played whole games in the beta being an absolutely manic Recon, using all the tools, gadgets and abilities to their absolute maximum as they were intended, supporting my team and squad as best i could. Hundreds of spots, dozens of beacon spawns in key areas, sensors picking up enemies behind key choke points, taking out enemies and vehicles with C4 as well counter sniping and picking off unsuspecting enemies. What did I get for all this? Bottom third of the leaderboard with just under 4,000 points.

# 5) Mitigating Side Effects

Now, there is the problem of enemy players being difficult to spot among the chaos and rubble especially with everyone being kitted out in modern, and very effective, camo which I think is why Dice have added the self-only auto-spot whenever you aim near enemies. This, in my opinion, is a bandaid solution and one that should only be temporary. There are many ways to solve this problem. I'm not a professional UI designer or Art Director but a solution could be as follows. A subtle, non-immersion breaking version of  the coloured ""outline"", ""glow"" or ""film"" you see around enemy players in other FOS games like Halo Infinate. I'm not suggesting that Dice make every enemy glow bright red but what I am suggesting is that they use something like this to make enemy silhouettes more distinct from the background colour pallette. And thus slightly more visible to players on the enemy team. Got a desert map where the character models are wearing tan or multicam? Add a subtle semi-transparent mid-brown and/or olive green overlay to the player's character model when seen by enemies. Got a dense forrest map? Add a light-green or tan overlay to the enemy character models. This would make enemies slightly easier to see while maintaining immersion and still making the players pay attention to and interact with with actual environment rather than just looking for red dots. Then when a Recon does spot an enemy and add that red dot above their heads: it's a godsend, and you're greatful to the Recon on your team/squad who helped you out. In addition to the previous points, this could be augmented to act as an extra bonus for Recon players with their stand-out colour overlay being less prominent than. non-Recon players. Like instead of the overlay being at 50% opacity for other players it's only 30% for the Recon class, adding to the stealthy mystique which their real-life counterparts gain.

# 6) Bringing It All Together

In conclusion: I think this change would complete the teamwork jigsaw that Dice is trying to create with the class system. Perhaps controversially, I really like what they've done with the Assault, Engineer and Support classes. Each class has a distinct, important and unique part of the puzzle but no one class can achieve victory alone. Only when all 4 classes come together and put their pieces of the puzzle together does your team start to fire on all cylinders. And when this happens it feels \*\*GOOD\*\*. For this puzzle to be complete, Recons also need their own Unique and valuable contribution to the team dynamic and I believe restricting spotting to Recon exclusively would not only complete the class system but also solve the tiring and unfulfilling problems of player over-visibility and lack of immersion in the environment, thus improving the game experience massively!

Thanks for listening to my TED talk. I'd love to hear further discussion in the comments.

The Devs from BF6 have confirmed with Portal there will be a server browser. In Portal, you will find verified experiences and custom made experiences. Verified being DICE servers, custom made is by Players.

Let's not kid ourselves: who has ever used the game mode search option in BF3 / BF4? Nobody. Everybody used the server browser to find their own experience which fits best for oneself.

Why should open or closed really matter? In the end of the day, most of the players will either way just go into server browsers and filter whatever they want.

Same thing with 12v12 rush. You don't like it? Good, your opinion. But you can modify rush to be 32v32 at release in Portal, so I'm really not sure why ppl are arguing over this stuff? Can someone explain it to me?

This release literally gives us the most tools to make a badass custom player made experience in this franchises history with custom modes, custom modifiers like player count etc.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx307a/why_is_everyone_so_hung_up_on_open_or_closed/,Battlefield,1755859189.0,34,0.37,Battlefield 6

Dear Community, after waiting a few days on a reply, today I got advised by the EA Support after reaching out to try and post here/discord/twitter and see if there is support.

Following issue: During the last few hours of the BF6 Open Beta I still grinded to get the Repairing Challenge aswell as the Reach Rank 15 complete - which I manged to do, but during my last few missions the progress bar was stuck and not moving further... For the repairing I played multiple rounds engineer, running after tanks/apc's and repairing only, the bar not moving up further... Same when reaching Rank 15, the bar did not change... The challanges were not yet expired and seemed to be active, but no progress was logged...

Is there still a way to get those rewards? Really would've loved to have those available playing on launch.

Thanks in advance for any support.

My current build was top of the line when I built it 7-8 years ago i9-9990k, 2080ti, 32gb ddr4. Since then, I haven't followed PC parts much at all. I know AMD is the CPU king now, but I don't even know when they surpassed Intel lol.

My PC has served me well, but playing at 1440p on current gen games I'm starting to feel its age. I'm OK playing at low/medium graphics, but after the BF6 beta it got me wanting to go to my next build. Getting only 60~ fps at everything lowest setting felt pretty bad.

Was wondering if next CPU generation cycle is projected to have significant performance leaps for gaming. I realize it's probably just rumors at this point, but I'd be willing to wait 1-1.5 years if there are spicy rumors of next gen looking real good etc.

I hate to admit but the pricing has even desensitised me over time. £20 for the season pass 3x a year, £80 pre-orders for a random packs, seeing £90 signature card bundles etc. It has made me reflect and I’ve probably spent over £100 on this game since the Great Beyond was released.

This might be a hot take, but ***Specialist personalities.*** Their voice acting is well done and I love how much of a massive variety of voice lines each of them have, for so many different situations and call-outs. Some of them even respond to each other specifically in certain contexts (I had an interaction earlier where Mackay acknowledged a Defend order from Dozer when I pinged his command.) They all sound cool, well-made, and highly characteristic. Mackay is silly but no-nonsense when it matters, Casper is cool-headed and austere, Boris is just fucking awesome. I just like them a lot and I will genuinely miss them.

To be clear, the super cringe voice lines in the game's early lifespan sucked. There's no argument against that - they were ***bad*** and detracted from the experience immensely. However, the characterization of the Specialists and their interactions shined after dev tweaks over time. I always look forward to hearing their one liner whenever I return to the main menu. I've really grown to like them and I'm quite comfortable with them; I'll miss them in BF6. I like the faceless goon aesthetic too, don't get me wrong, but you can still have a masked elite soldier with a bit of characteristic.

2. Casper's drone. Sometimes when I'm sniping, the battleline shifts and I'm no longer in a solid position to provide marksman support but it would take too long for me to shift into a new, better position to help out. So instead I can just pull up the drone and mark the enemies on the point so my allies know what they're getting into. I also enjoy using it to scout ahead of my path to make sure I won't get spotted before getting into a good sniping position - practically guaranteeing that I'm always going to reach a spot where I'll be able to help my team. The drone's versatility is something I've come to bring the full potential out of, and I enjoy it a lot. Not having such a helpful, versatile tool is going to be sad.

3. Angel's versatility. Because of his kit, I can bring a medical pack and support the team and myself in a multitude of different ways. He inherently provides ammo and gadget refills, he can heal if you bring a medpack, and he can revive anybody. I played BF4 for 16 hours (it was fun) and I always felt like I was missing Angel's robust kit. He's great offensively with low ammo-economy weapons and grenades due to ease of self-supply, and he's great at holding a position with your team thanks to his ability to resupply others fully, and (optionally) heal. He's a great comfort pick and I'll miss him.

4. Mackay's grapple hook. I loved using it in intelligent, strategic, and tactical ways. Getting the jump on snipers, getting into better flanking positions, etc. I always felt rewarded for using it well and I'll miss it when I play BF6.

5. Some of the skins are incredible. Mackay's CoD Ghost-style skin (released very early in the game's lifespan) is still one of my most-used, favorite skins on any character in the game.

  
6. Call-ins. Ranger was always fun to play with. He's gotten me plenty of kills, helped me cap a lot of points, and each Specialist even has voice lines for his commands. They didn't \*have\* to code commands for him, but they did, allowing players who want to use him tactically the ability to do so. 



Heli or Jet bothering you? Nobody on your team dealing with it, thinking someone else will do it? Call in a Wildcat and fuck it up. 



Is your team sieging? Got a tank in the garage? Drop it in and roll out.



Call-ins made the battle experience a lot smoother, more consistent, and more fun imo.

In closing, I hope this post shows people that somehow believe 2042 to have no redeeming qualities are very wrong, and I hope that at least some of these qualities will be reimplemented in BF6 in some way or another. I know they're going for something different, but these aspects of 2042 can still be translated into a more grounded setting.",False,/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mwzxgv/things_im_going_to_miss_from_2042_going_into_bf6/,Battlefield6,1755847528.0,3,0.31,Discussion

I haven’t had many issues with the controller on any other game (aside from some random moments it would continue to fire on Call of Duty until I pressed the trigger again, but that hasn’t happened in a while). 

So with Battlefield 2042 and 6 I’m having problems where it either won’t fire randomly, will fire in bursts, or I will continue to lay down shots and it will just randomly stop. I can get 5-6 kills normally then the next couple will just have random firing issues. It’s only an issue with these games and this controller. I’ve tried both the Xbox Elite V2 and PS4 with no issues. It only happens with these 2 games. The other Battlefields work no problem, same with CoD and other shooters. 

The controller is up to date, all buttons/triggers/sticks show that they function as they should. I’ve messed with deadzones and the trigger locks and that didn’t do anything. I’m really at a loss as I’d prefer to use this controller and not have to switch to other controllers just for 2 games. 

Has anyone had these issues and/or any idea on what else I might be able to do before sending this controller in for warranty? It’s only a few months old and has been babied. ",False,/r/8bitdo/comments/1mwzi5v/issues_with_8bitdo_ultimate_2_on_bf2042_and_bf6/,8bitdo,1755845932.0,4,1.0,Question

So I wanted to post here and see what sort of a discussion we could create in relation to the BF6 beta and what we all think it needs and doesn't need. Personally I've played every BF game since Bad Company 1 with the exception of Hardline and 2042. Because of this I felt compelled to give my opinion based on what I saw in the beta because Battlefield really is one of my favorite franchises in gaming. Please feel free to comment and discuss what changes you liked and disliked and let's try and spark a great discussion that could result in some positive change. 

I want to start by saying that all in all I actually had a good bit of fun on the beta, and although I have a few things that I believe could be done better I think DICE have a really good base for what could be a really great battlefield game. 

Below are some game mechanics I believe could be refined and changed slightly to produce something truly special. 

Movement speed: I think it would be really easy to change the pace of the game by slowing down movement speed just a tad. Perhaps a mechanic where long periods of running give you a touch of tunnel vision or slight vignette. I think a BF game lends itself to a more tactical style of movement as opposed to jumping round corners and seeing who can get a shot off first. I'd personally welcome a more milsim(ish) style of game play. 

Surpression: I loved the no passive healing  whilst being suppressed mechanic, but there wasn't much physical change to the screen when under fire. I think if being suppressed  had more of an effect on the players screen perhaps we might get more people using it as a tactic as opposed to trying to secure long range kills as a primary defense. 

Awareness assist: So I personally thought something was off with the spotting but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Frequently I could see enemy markers through smoke or walls which just essentially gives the players hacks. I believe if this system were taken away entirely and replaced with a more elaborate ping system that can only be shared primarily amongst squads and then also through squad leaders we might get further reason to use suppression as a tactic. 

Hit markers: I get why a lot of people like hit markers. I just think maybe we could change them? Replace HUD style hit markers for blood spray and you instantly have something that aids the player in feeling immersed in the combat. On top of that I think taking away hit markers means smoke is even more effective because you won't know if you've hit something or not whilst firing through it. This will encourage the further use of suppression. 

To summarise, I think BF6 has the potential to be a really exceptional shooter. With the changes I'm suggesting here I really think this will be one for the fans. Currently though the game feels a bit flat. I think things like HUD based hit markers, fast movement speed and  awareness assist through marked enemies makes the game feel like it's been made to draw another fan based in and not one made for the battlefield fan. Personally I believe that these suggestions might make the game feel more like a team game and drive players to play the objective rather than run around trying to get as many kills as possible.

DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) are no joke. If you are sitting still for multiple hours, you aren't using your leg muscles (especially calve muscles). Your blood can't return back to the heart by itself as it has lost most of its speed by the time it gets to returning to the heart, so your calve muscles squeeze to help move the blood back to the heart. If you aren't using your calve muscles (i.e. you've been sitting for too long - commonly due to a long flight, a long surgery or an average Battlefield gaming session) then you are at risk of your blood remaining still (stagnant). Sometimes, this blood can clot. This is very dangerous as the clot can dislodge and get stuck in your heart or lungs, leading to serious problems like pulmonary embolism or cardiomyopathy which can cause arrhythmias and death. You can't PTFO if you're dead. Think of this as tactically redeploying so you're out of the action of the game for a short duration but then you're back with full ammo and max grenades.

PCIE3 msata from old build with Windows11


**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

PC build with old 500W PSU and drives from old build.

CPU is extremely hot compared to my earlier Ryzen 5 3600, never saw it below 70 degrees.
Can set the fans to max, temps dont change.

Didnt boot the first time when both sticks where inserted.

PC randomly just shuts off, non-replicable but not under load.

BF6 Beta played without problems, Helldivers 2 sets gpu fans on max (but I thinks its a rather unoptimized game).

As of now it always happend while watching yt videos in Edge, some times 5 minutes after a cold start, some times after hours of gaming and then switching over to watching videos.


**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Thought of PSU being underpowered so I changed the 500W PSU, issue still happening.

Cleaned former nvidia drivers, still happening.

Redone thermal paste twice (initially with the cooler provided paste in a thicker layer, 
then the old school pea sized drop, then two thin lines spaced apart but that dropped temps in idle from 80 to 75), no change, temps still high.

Going to change the CPU for a newer Ryzen 5 running not that hot, cant rule out that the board
interprets the always high temps (average 86 degrees on CPU, 95 on package according to 
HWMonitor) as reason to shut of when load goes away.

There was a dev comment screenshot posted here saying they are 'looking into' the autospotting, but that's equally concerning because most people agree it simply needs to be removed and recon should get an alternative passive. It doesn't need to be adjusted, it needs to be deleted.

The bigger problem is a lack of server browser and persistent lobbies. I won't go into when this is such a big issue as it's been discussed to death but it's huge, especially for players like me in lower pop regions. We will probably have a server browser in Portal but it may not have persistent lobbies and Portal itself may be hidden in the atrocious Netflix UI. Also no mention of changes to the UI, which is universally hated. 

The changes addressed in the debrief are good, but we should be worried about the omission of these two major pain points for the community.

That being why i have 1000 hours into it. Anyway, with all that time ove never played hazard zone and decided before bf6 I want to attempt a platinum trophy on ps. 

I have sone maybe 15 matches in hazard zone now and this one seems it will take forever. Do people not play for the objectives or extractions? I still dont fully 100% get what you're supposed to do aside from collecting the data and extracting but it seems like if I stay with the group, the ones I've been in, they go to a location no where near data files or extraction points but of I go by myself i tend to get smoked.

1mwyzdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,,0,Battlefield has always been fast-paced,Repeat34,False,True,False,,False,"Battlefield has been “COD-like” ever since BF3. As someone who’s sunk thousands of hours into every Battlefield since then—along with plenty of time in Arma, Squad, Hell Let Loose, and Tarkov—I honestly don’t understand why players keep complaining about fast-paced movement (within reason, of course—not teleporting like BF4 or exploiting ledge glitches in the beta).

**Here’s the core issue:** Battlefield maps and gameplay were never designed around slow, tactical movement. The reason Arma, Squad, and Tarkov *do* work with slower pacing is because nearly every design decision in those games supports realism—or at least the perception of it. Things like stamina bars, stricter health systems, massive spread-out maps, and limited spawn mechanics are all built to force slower, methodical play.

Battlefield is the opposite. It has always thrived on chaos, spectacle, and streamlined mechanics. Huge maps with tons of cover, vehicles flying overhead, instant squad spawns, and dozens of players crashing into objectives all at once. If you try to force slower pacing into that environment, Battlefield stops feeling like Battlefield—it just becomes a worse version of Arma or Squad (and a headglitch fest at that).

Fast movement has always been part of Battlefield’s identity, and frankly, it’s what makes it fun. Even in the BF6 beta, it’s still the *slowest* Battlefield we’ve had since BF3—even with the knife out. A lot of the “crazy” clips people point to are just movement glitches, and even when they aren’t, that kind of movement usually hurts the player more than it helps.

It really feels like some people want Battlefield to turn into Arma or Squad. And I say this as someone who *loves* those games—if that’s what you want, go play them! They scratch that itch perfectly. But Battlefield has always been an arcade shooter at its core, and trying to slow it down or “realism it up” ruins what makes it unique.

I’d genuinely like to hear any solid counterarguments or feedback, but for me, Battlefield’s fast-paced, chaotic movement is a feature, not a flaw. And the last thing I want is for it to become another watered-down version of COD or some pseudo-milsim clone.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,Battlefield,1755843959.0,15,0.4,Battlefield 6

So treating it as a BF themed hero-shooter game and to my surprise it's quite fun and less fatiguing to play than bf6 beta. Would recommend (just not as a proper BF), quicks thoughts after playing:

Pros:
-Huge maps with various verticality and weathers and it's going for that big BF sandbox experience (opposite of BF6 beta) which I love.

-Excellent gun and vehicle selections and customizations, especially vehicles

-128 players on the right maps

Cons:
-Many map elements are too generic and sterile, obvious downgrades from previous titles. (tho still prefer it over the cramped bf6 maps)

-Both gun and vehicle handling are mediocore to bad (twitchy and floaty). 

-Forgettable music and soulless voicelines, leagues behind bf3/4/1

-no server browsers outside portal

If the old DICE (employees left by 2018) were able to work on this games and not make so many fundamental flaws, it would probably be one of the best BFs",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwxr9k/had_more_fun_and_less_tired_in_bf2042_than_in_bf6/,Battlefield,1755839579.0,6,0.41,Battlefield 2042

I have two points reasons that work for me, but I acknowledge that everyone has a different play style. 

1.  Smg preferred weapon means you have slightly better hip fire control. Hip fire control on an smg is already very easy to manage and it has a diminishing return after a certain point. However, if you're running an LMG, being able to run just as fast as everyone else when you're being a team player is crucial! Switching to a knife to keep up with the squad when everyone has guns out isn't always viable. 

2.  LMG is a great support weapon. I'm not running out being the tip of the spear for my squad. I'm laying down sustained fire to cover my team while they advance regardless of map size. That L110 200x round mag says that no enemy is peaking that alley while my assault or recon mates are moving up. 
If whoever is in front of me goes down, I'm prefiring my gun around the corner and sweeping the WHOLE  room while peaking the corner until I see that kill marker pop up. This got me more kills in close quarters against smg/assault/carbine users than anything else. 

I ran a mix of closed and open games. I prefer closed weapons, yes I'll miss SMG on Support, but I can always run a different class or play around with whichever carbine best works close range, which happened to be the meta in beta. 
 
I think having the LMG speed buff is higher value than the small smg handling buff and the LMG is useful on maps of all sizes in team play. On bigger maps like Liberation Peak I'd switch to a silenced, fast mag, hs multiplier on the KTS100. Small maps was 200 mag L110. 

Don't even get me started on if you catch a squad unaware and you can just mow them all down... This beta actually made me enjoy using an LMG finally after all the years of being a smg/dmr main, switching between the two based on the map, and it felt good. My only complaint in LMG vs SMG is that I felt like SMGs  were too good at a distance in BF6 which was my second most played weapon class (I tried them all out) and LMGs do need a more impactful suppression effect.

I am only making this post to see if there have been any updates, or workarounds that have been discovered recently due to these CPU's being locked out from undervolting. 

I own an Acer Nitro 5 laptop with an i7-12650H/4060. My clockspeed/voltages are either full balls to the wall to the point of thermal throttling and destroying performance or not, no in between. I have messed with throttlestop some but I'm not having too much luck with it.

Keep in mind, I've had this laptop for a year, this has been the case since the day I bought it, I even have a laptop cooling pad, I have yet to change the thermal paste though < Might be my problem?

I often disable the intel ""Turbo Boost"" through throttlestop. Which is fine as I'm still able to get optimal performance in a majority of modern titles. Sadly with some more recent games this isn't the case. 

My CPU gets around 70c with it running at around 25-30 watts at 2.3ghz with turbo boost disabled on the default fan settings in NitroSense, the fans are only slightly audible. 

I really, really, really, just wish I could have more control over my voltages/frequencys, as Nitro sense on its own just simply is not enough. 

This became very apparent in the recent BF6 beta.  Seeing my laptop perform like a 1660TI desktop PC is pretty disheartening. 

  
Sorry for the rant - TL:DR - Any recent workarounds for undervolting or changing the frequency's of  an i7 12650h.

Doesn’t seem like it will be in any of the maps, doesn’t seem like swimming is even a mechanic of the game. Is there any updates on whether it’ll come to the game perhaps in a future update? I’d sell my kidneys for a paracel storm remake, and even an entire naval warfare season post launch that brings back carrier assault. I know this game will focus heavily on Europe and America rather than the pacific like BF4. But come on a naval warfare update with maps in the Bahamas, Florida Keys or hell even Ibiza would be awesome. 

2. How does customisation work? We obviously know we are getting soldier skins but is it going to be like 2042 and other cod games? Or is it going to be like BFV with its outfit packs and the ability to mix and match packs? I’ve always thought BFV had the perfect customisation mechanic it was just hindered by stupid skins that betrayed the ww2 aesthetic, it wasn’t very immersive being revived by the phantom of the opera. On the other hand when DICE dropped the more historically accurate skins for all the factions it was awesome and being able to mix and match packs was even cooler. Would love to see this feature return as it offered so much more player choice than operator skins we got in 2042. Also skins will be locked to either faction right? Surely?

Cause it got refunded within 2 hours/ 4 Online games.

Where do I start? 

\#1) Ping/Server issues.... I played 4 online games, all over 60+ ping (I get 20-30 in EVERY other game I play, even less with some like Fortnite/OW). The passing was delayed, the animations were SO emphasized, and I felt like my players were playing in Ice the whole time... Which I felt I had very little control over my defenders.... Which leads me to point #2

\#2) Defense and Defenders.... I have NEVER had an easier time passing 97 VVD then I did today. All 4 games had SEVERAL goals within 30 minutes. I had one game.... 13-9.... another 12-5, and another 12-6 (all wins btw, still didnt have fun)....This is coming from past games where I pride myself in defending, but no matter WHAT setting I did... I felt like I could not defend AT ALL... and my Ops were the same way

\#3) WHY ARE THEY GIVING US TOTW 97's TO TEST THE GAME??? the whole point is to play the game with low level cards like we would at the start..... Why give me 99 Pace Mbappe that can run around all of the team without anyone stopping him? and that leads to #4

\#4) Dribbling and Offense is CRRAAZZZYYYY strong.... the fact that there was a goal in EVERY GAME within the first kickoff was nuts, legit every game started with a kickoff goal. The ""run down the line cut back"" meta is still there, dribbling felt WAY too good on a player like Hansen, she shouldnt just R1 run and sprint around the whole pitch....

All and All, I still see the SAME glaring issues that plagued FC25 and I simply cannot put myself thru another year of this game. SO glad I got a chance to save myself the pain, onto BF6 and Borderlands 4 :)

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming.

Po meni su se uglavnom vratili na stare staze sto je odlicno, igrao sam dve open bete i ovakav osecaj dok sam igrao battlefield igricu nisam imao od BF4 (koji je izasao 2013. inace). Puske i pucanje su odlicne (tu je po meni za neke puske manja zamerka malo slabiji recoil ali to mogu da poprave do oktobra, mada je to EA pa se nikad ne zna), mape su po meni sasvim zadovoljavajuce mada bi trebali da dodaju nekoliko vecih mapa do izlaska igrice.

1mwuwff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwuwff/as_a_dominationkoth_exclusive_enjoyer_bf6_is/,,1,"As a Domination/KOTH Exclusive Enjoyer, BF6 Is ALMOST Perfect",GarageDoorOpener2,False,True,False,,False,"As someone who doesn't usually play Battlefield, playing BF6's Call of Duty-esque game modes was extremely enjoyable for me. For the first time in a long time, I got my casual balls to the walls brainrot fix from Domination and KOTH, something that I didn't think was going to happen. Obviously, I know the wider Battlefield community will not be playing it all that much, but I got a lot of BO2 and XDefiant vibes from these game modes and it made me sit down for nearly ten hours straight on the first day of global beta access. 

It also helped that it still had some Battlefield flavor with revives, support, and a stronger emphasis on objective play. I really liked how I could slay out and cap flags or push hills at the same time, while pulling my squadmates away from gunfire so my team would have more help putting pressure on the enemies. It was always very satisfying to see myself on the top of the scoreboard of my team almost every single time because the way these modes are set up makes it very easy to do both simultaneously. It's real good fun.

There are a couple of issues with these game modes, though, and I think they're actually pretty simple to implement.

The first thing I would change is to actually make the respawn timer longer. In contrast to Conquest, these game modes have it where you can respawn immediately after being downed, and then the game decides where you spawn as opposed to picking your spawn yourself.

Now, I really like games where I can die and immediately get back in with very little downtime, which, if I'm being honest, is why Battlefield never really caught my interest in the past. But, I would argue that the timer to respawn is too quick. Because the objective is more pronounced in Battlefield as opposed to other games, having as many people around the objective is a good strat if you're trying to get time on the hill during KOTH for example.

So what ends up happening is that in most lobbies, people tend to forego reviving or dropping medpacks because its assumed that you'll just spawn right back in. But this is counter intuitive because the game usually spawns you pretty far away from the objective after dying, which means that it's extremely hard to actually make a comeback, unless your team can get the jump on the next point, or the next rotation on Domination. And if a medic or squadmate is nearby, players decide to bleed out when they were just about to revived, which has happened both to me and happened to many medics that I've given up on because I was convinced no one would revive me.

So if the timer is just a little slower, then this problem may be fixed.

Another issue is that at least with a couple maps, some of the objective spots were a little poorly thought out. The best example I can give is on Empire State KOTH, where the D hill is at that Gazebo spot. On that hill, almost no one can get time on it because the bounds of that hill are so wide that both teams are always constantly on it, and if one team does happen to take control, the other team virtually can't make any play to take control themselves because of the layout of the hill. Some objectives just need some adjusting, and while I can't give specific feedback on how to fix them, at the very least I can make it known that it's a bit of a frustrating issue.

Other than that, I don't really think I have much to say other than what everyone else is saying. Nerf movement a little bit, nerf shotgun, wipe with some elbow grease, and we should be good to go. I had a lot of fun with these game modes and I'm excited to potentially main BF6 for a good while.

Before playing this game, I've only seen it on steam or just the cover for it, and then I watch a video made by Tbag Gaming which showed gameplay that caught my interest. The gameplay looked pretty similar to battlefield and the beta for bf6 just ended recently so I thought I'd try out the game on PS5

It's day 2 of playing the game, so I tried out the operations mode and my first real warfare match after doing a practice with AI. And I just feel so confused overall. I see that there's a campaign story but I don't see where to play it? Is it through the operations? The Black Hawk Down mission? Or something else I'm not seeing? I watch these cutscenes with these characters and the villain being broken out of a prison, but nothing about a campaign story about them to play, at least not that I can see on the game.

The controls are a mess in my opinion, mainly the keybinds for gadgets, I have a lot of moments where I'm trying to use one thing and keep pulling out another. The menu navigation feels annoying, because I can't seem to back out completely and view every mode or option there is, but I'm instead forced to switch between them. The controls sometimes actually bug out and you can't do stuff on random menus including when trying to deploy in a match, or the cursor will just completely disable itself at random times.

Not sure how I feel about operators but they're okay I guess, at least this game seems to be made for them unlike 2042. Is this supposed to be mainly multiplayer where the story and context is just in cutscenes or something?

I really hope the game improves on console over time, because I don't want to drop it already. If anyone has any starting advice, I'd appreciate it.",False,/r/DeltaForceGlobal/comments/1mwuvfw/this_game_has_me_confused/,DeltaForceGlobal,1755830503.0,6,0.67,Discussion 🗣️

They hosted all the popular games and had an incredible forum that I have  many fond memories of. A lot of work went into this infrastructure of hosting servers for games and interesting to see how that job has basically died and been replaced with no name or face AWS/kubernetes style automations which are completely soulless. How can we bring back the sense of community that once existed on these platforms in today's modern cloud infrastructure economy? What happened to clans?

Capture drives,
Survive,
Exfil,
Repeat

What I don't understand or don't fully understand is the following:

When capturing hard drives, do enemies get any information on where I am and what I'm doing?

Can multiple teams share one exfil?

What do I need to grab to call my squad back from death? (is it the unlink things?)

Are there only 2 chances to exfil?

What exactly is the point of capturing hard drives?

And lastly, the typical question that I am sure has been asked numerous times regarding this

Are the only people left playing it the people who only play this mode and do they purposely ignore drives just to hunt squads? Thats been my experience in the few matches I've had.

The trophies are as follows:

Extract without anyone dying in your squad (I wish I could turn squad fill off for this)

Extract 25 times (sounds painful)

Extract with 50 data drives (I assume not all at once)",False,/r/battlefield2042/comments/1mwty88/trying_to_platinum_2042_before_bf6_releases/,battlefield2042,1755827860.0,2,1.0,Question
