Estou querendo trocar minha gpu pra jogar o BF6 e outros games nesse nível, e futuramente num qhd.

Meu setup é: 
Processador: Intel Core i5-12400

BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.

For basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.

Here’s why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:

* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It’s frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.
* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That’s why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It’s not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it’s the only way they can “balance” sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. 
* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads—covering the 300–600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.
* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they’re not every squad—they’re specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they’d work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.
* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.
* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won’t be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.

Battlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I’m fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.

I’ve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).

After BO6, which I didn’t enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I’m well aware those trailers don’t necessarily reflect the multiplayer.

Yesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.

My takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn’t fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).
I loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it’s supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we’re getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay—and so much fun.

So, I’m optimistic, but of course I’ll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let’s hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins).

Follow these steps to get your rewards!",Burkely31,False,True,False,,False,"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25



So, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.

  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)

  
At the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. ""How to Unbind My Account"" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted ""mess"" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to ""connections"" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. 

  
  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. 

  
  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my ""own"" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to ""Delta Force App"". 

  
  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***

*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***
*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.
*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has ""Drops Enabled"". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.
*  
*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see ""**Delta Force App"". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** 

*   \*\*\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on ""Connect"" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces ""Level Infitite"" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \*\*\*\*\*
* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the ""Login with email and password"" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!
*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click ""Connect"" or you can likely just click on ""Claim"" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \*\*\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on ""Step #2"" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the ""Delta Force App"" to your account. Accept that.
*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click ""claim"" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. 
*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and ""Claim"" the rewards!**

  
   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!

So I wanted to add a different perspective to the discussion and I guess I’m not the only one who actually likes the Battlefield 6 filters.

I don’t want the game to feel like just another generic realistic FPS shooter. I want it to feel like Battlefield 6.

Same thing with BF3. It might not look realistic in terms of color grading, but it feels like BF3. Every time I come back to it, I get the same feeling I had when I first played it all those years ago.

Nowadays, everything has to look as realistic as possible and honestly, I think that sucks the soul out of a lot of games and movies. It all starts to blur together. The BF6 filters give the game style, identity, and atmosphere. I’d rather have a game with a strong visual direction than one that looks like a tech demo.

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming.

Probably the biggest fan of the OG stuff. I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.

- ""Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone"".

Yet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.

- ""Why would I not use armor, thats stupid""

You're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.

- ""You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless"".

Fair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.

- ""Weapon rarity sucks"".

No it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.

- ""BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists"".

The fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.

- ""Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6""

Okay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?

These aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment.

I have since watched the franchise go through its evolution (?) and am aware there’s a new game coming out. I don’t own a PC, console, or even a TV, but I’d happily find a way to play if BF6 will incorporate attack helicopters the way BF2-4 did.

In Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it’s so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. 

Sadly, I don’t see this changing too much at this point because it’s a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can’t be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don’t have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You’d only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.

This approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

What bothers me most is the map design in the game.  
It's either open plains with very little cover, through which you have to run for hundreds of meters on foot to get to the next objective (because simple transport vehicles like jeeps, quads and dirtbikes are in short supply for some reason, despite the maps being huge) - this makes you just a sitting duck for snipers and vehicles or everyone who sees you and you can be shot from either direction... and why is the terrain so flat and open on so many maps? 

Or it's the other extreme, narrow corridors where both teams end in a stalemate, spam smokes and explosives and when you try to push through, you have 10 guns pointed at you and you immediately die.

MGS Delta sai logo logo e já temos benchmarks ruins do game. Sofrendo pra rodar em ótimas GPUs (tipo a RTX 4060) e nos consoles de mesa (PS5 e PS5 PRO). Esse era um dos jogos que eu tava mais hypando pra jogar no lançamento e agora toda a vontade se foi por causa da preguiça crônica do desenvolvedor de querer otimizar o jogo corretamente. 

Outros exemplos: TESIV Oblivion Remastered. Como já podem ver pela minha flair, meu hardware, sim, é de entrada, especialmente em 2025. Porém, consigo rodar muitos jogos em qualidade alta sem suar. Red Dead 2, RE4 Remake (naquele preset priorizar qualidade), AC Mirage, BF6, entre outros. TODOS ESSES graficamente muito mais impressionantes que Oblivion. E ainda assim, depois de 4 meses de lançamento, o jogo continua injogável na minha máquina. Engasgos, ghosting, input lag, bugs que quebram o jogo, etc. Este era o jogo que eu mais queria jogar esse ano.

Aí que eu me pergunto: em que momento se tornou aceitável pagar 70 dólares em jogos incompletos? Em que momento ficamos de cabeça abaixada pra desenvolvedoras que não tem a mínima vontade de ao menos trabalhar em fazer pelo menos os reflexos da água, vidro etc sem recorrer ao Ray Tracing, que, apesar de impressionante visualmente, é inviável pra 70, 80% dos jogadores de PC? 

É ultrajante, no mínimo.

(aos que vão comentar logo, sim, eu entendo que a UE5 é muito acessível pra estúdios menores e que vai ser o padrão da indústria logo. Mas peguem Expedition 33 como um exemplo. Aquilo é jogo bonito e otimizado de maneira decente.)

Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
€1200\~1500 have be available to buy within Ireland or from a company that will not have import fees added so no UK websites.

**Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No

**How would you prioritize form factor (Ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Thin and light as possible for the other requirements. Also would like it to be quite while doing general collage work as to not hinder other students.

**How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Weight and thinness are very important to me — I’m looking for something easy to carry while traveling.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
14\~16""

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Yes, Cad for modeling some light 3d models for 3d printing as well as small bit of gaming while traveling. Have a gaming desktop.

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Play ark: ascended, war thunder, bf6 but generally not trying game on the laptop.

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Good Keyboard, good build quality, has to allow for usb-c charging even if only while running on integrated graphics.

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
Looking for a bit of help with this decision trying to keep the laptop as a work, study tool as opposed to gaming due to the fact that it would hinder my productivity but would be nice to have the option of some moderate gaming while traveling etc. **Generally worried about being tethered to a wall socket while running basic applications for collage work.**

Have a few laptop's in mind but cant come to a final decision on any of them:

Option #1: **Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 Gen 10 (16” AMD)**: R7 AI7 350, RTX 5050 8GB v-ram, 32gb ram, 1tb SSD

Like the option best because it would allow me to do Lenovo's advanced insurance for the 4 year care plan. But no Guaranteed shipping date and from some reviews the shipping can be delayed as its a build to order. Says ships within 6-9 days.

€1500\~ inc shipping and warranty

Option #2: **Asus Vivobook Pro 15 Oled N6506CU:** Intel® Core Ultra 9 Processor 285H, RTX 4050 6GB v-ram, 16gb ram, 1tb SSD.

Reason I like this option is it is currently available to order and delivery is within the week but no option for a extended warranty. From what I've read ram is expandible to at least 24gb ram according to ASUS website.

€1200

Open to further options but please share links.

I would buy a 1440p 144hz monitor at minimum. I was looking at the 4070 or 4070 Super and my processor (5600x) and it appears to get around 80-85fps on Ultra at 1440p. Is this good or mediocre?

Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.

I know that there are ""night"" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?

The only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white).

Seems to be a BUG in the Bios F12 to LAST F15 apparently, If I disable CSM It will Boot Once but next time nope so need to forcing Clear CMOS and Load Default. 
It will happen whether you activate it or not the Secure Boot.

The Only Solution I found was to ""Update"" to BIOS F11 (Nov 07, 2018), last bios wit Secure Boot working because the Next One (F12, Mar 15, 2019) to last one just had that Bug appareantly

After that I have Secure Boot activated and everything Ok... Too Bad there's no Resizable-BAR because was implemented on F15b :'D

Should i sell the PC as a whole and build brand new AM5 build (posted on marketplace for. Bragain price £670)

Or sell GPU and CPU and upgrade to 5700x3D / 9070  and remain within the end of life AM4 for a bit longer

1myfjad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asustuf/comments/1myfjad/upgrade_my_current_asus_tuf_or_not/,,1,Upgrade my current Asus Tuf or not,exjw_darthfader,False,True,False,,False,"Hi all

I'm not entirely computer savvy when it comes to this stuff so a simple yes or no answer is fine!

I currently have an Asus tuf model FX505DD- BQ145T. Ive owned for roughly for 5ish years.

I upgraded the ram to 16gb and installed a secondary 1tb SSD in the spare slot.

I've never have any issues with it apart from the fans going wild with moderate use.

I now do a bit of content creation for a game I play which I record and stream IRL overhead gameplay with a camera + elgato camlink and OBS.

Sometimes these streams will go for 10+ hours non-stop as we are steaming card game events in store.

The last time I used my Asus (as it's a spar machine for me), about 8 hours in we had some issues with the stream dropping in frame rates which I'm assuming we may have reached the limitations of the Asus tuf.

I found an Asus tuf on clearance for around $1500AUD (FA506NCR-HN016W) or what I'm assuming is a more budget model (FA506NCR-HN040W) for $1100AUD.

Is it worth upgrading or are there some further modifications I can make to my current model that will be sufficient for what I use it for?

Also if I wanted to run game like fortnite, rivals, helldiver's, bf6 etc, would this still suffice? (I'm assuming not)

I tried playing bf6 and I wasn't too happy with the performance. I wanted to get the rx 9060xt, but realized I probably have to upgrade my CPU as well. (AM4 Motherboard)

My budget is tight at the moment so which option is the best:

1. Buy the 9060xt and wait for the CPU upgrade

2. Buy the CPU upgrade such as the r7 5800xt and then wait to upgrade GPU.

3. Wait until I can buy both because the bottleneck would be too limiting. 

This would be 1080p gaming. I don't care that much about 4k or 1440p and I prioritize FPS and the overall feel/smoothness but don't want to have to use low settings for single player games.  I play a lot of multiplayer games (r6, the finals, battlefield, marvel rivals etc.) But I also play a good amount of AAA single player ones as well and want to play some new titles (BM Wukong, MH Wilds, New Metal Gear, Stellar Blade etc.) 

Any advice would be helpful!

1myehur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1myehur/why_i_think_battlefield_6_has_a_really_strong/,,0,Why I think Battlefield 6 has a really strong launch lineup (and why DICE is on the right track),xDannySek,False,True,False,,False,"After reading all the info about BF6’s launch content, I honestly think DICE has a really solid foundation this time. Here’s what I’m hyped about and why:

* **Escalation mode** – this could be a *really* fun new experience. If it’s dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.
* **Maps** – the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. I’m especially hyped for Egypt – exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.
* **Classes + weapon progression** – finally we’ll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.
* **Portal** – if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, that’s going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.
* **Campaign** – I’m genuinely happy we’re getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.
* **Battle Royale** – this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BF’s scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.
* **Battle Pass** – not much to say yet, but if it’s not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, it’ll work fine.
* **Ranked mode** – I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.

Overall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they don’t screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.

I think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myehur/why_i_think_battlefield_6_has_a_really_strong/,Battlefield,1755986794.0,8,0.5,Battlefield 6

So just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.

Played the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good 

 I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify 

So BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other? Lmk",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myd1p2/which_has_worse_maps_bfv_or_2042/,Battlefield,1755983172.0,16,0.4,Discussion

I'm here looking to make new friends because after going through my friends list I realized 90% of them are in their 20s and don't relate to me... I enjoy anime, computers and some retro gaming(JRPGs). I'm always down to just chill and watch the sunset on RUST or climb the ranks in Apex. I'm in the eastern time zone and mostly play evening hours 7ish-12am.

Here are some games I've recently played and my takes on them.

BF6 beta - can't wait till October!

Dune Awakening - I had tons of fun but felt that endgame needs some TLC to keep replayability.

Apex legends - I'm a day one apex player that's slightly above average at best.

The Finals - I enjoy the direction this game has gone since release.

Stardew Valley - I just recently picked this up and don't know why cause it's so fun.

Clair Obscure Expedition 33 - Master piece...

1myakrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,,2,Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging,ystolai,False,True,False,,False,"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50–60 FPS or higher. The point is, it’s not just the icon showing up — when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don’t register on the enemy.

In reality, this isn’t exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.

This “phantom lag” happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can’t keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning — along with real gameplay lag.

# The solution I found

What pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:

* **Plugged in**:
   * SPL = 30W
   * SPPT = 30W
   * FPPT = 35W
* **On battery**:
   * SPL = 25W
   * SPPT = 25W
   * FPPT = 25W

With this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn’t really affect gameplay anymore.

# About packet loss

I was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  
Upgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference — now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.

# Why this works

1. **Fixed power delivery** → prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.
2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** → offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.
   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.
   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.

👉 In short:  
Stabilize your **power profiles** \+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally.",False,/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,ROGAlly,1755977209.0,6,0.67,Discussion

Ive roughly followed youtubers settings guides like silk and ghost however ive made some adjustments that i find easier personally these are as follows

Instead of pitch up/down being on L Ctrl and Spacebar ive put them on w and s respectively basically swapping them (with it also bound to mouse for strafing ground targets)

 I've also been using roll on a and d rather than mouse and yaw is on mouse instead of a and d

Ive found these inputs easier for me to work with as im still youngling in fps gaming with a kb+m but im curious if any experienced players think im shooting myself in the foot with these changes as ive gotten to an average level i am really looking to get back to where i was at a minimum

BF6 will put icons over enemy player's heads you cannot even see just if they're on your screen. Not even saying when they are marked by a friendly, I mean when you are facing their direction and the game just shows you where they are. That stuff is trash and needs to go.

I have to say, this is genuinely disappointing and worrying.

The beta felt fantastic. The pace was modern, frantic, and rewarding for aggressive, skilled play. Slowing everything down feels like a reactionary move to cater to a more passive, campy playstyle that has plagued other shooters.

This was our chance to have a true, fast-paced modern Battlefield. Slowing it down makes it feel more like a sluggish mil-sim than the all-out warfare sandbox we love. Please, DICE, don't sand down the edges that made the beta feel so fresh and engaging. Revert these changes.

Weekly missons can give you a total of 55 token which is equivalent to 5.5 levels. So total of weekly missions tokens would be 495 which is equivalent to 49.5 levels.
To farm faster in the game here is some tips:
1. Play conquest but play on close quarter mode where it's infantry based maps. You will be farming like there's no tomorrow 
2. Play the game during weekends due to XP boost weekend event. Playing during the weekends will give you 100% XP boost which could not only increase your level but faster to get the skins you want.
3. Play Support class to level up faster. By provide ammo, revives and suppress fire your your team and squadmates would give you more XP and lots of ribbons.
