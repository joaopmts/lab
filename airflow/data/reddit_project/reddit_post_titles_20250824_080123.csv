Probably the biggest fan of the OG stuff. I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.

- ""Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone"".

Yet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.

- ""Why would I not use armor, thats stupid""

You're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.

- ""You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless"".

Fair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.

- ""Weapon rarity sucks"".

No it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.

- ""BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists"".

The fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.

- ""Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6""

Okay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?

These aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment.

In Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. 

Sadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.

This approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

It's either open plains with very little cover, through which you have to run for hundreds of meters on foot to get to the next objective (because simple transport vehicles like jeeps, quads and dirtbikes are in short supply for some reason, despite the maps being huge) - this makes you just a sitting duck for snipers and vehicles or everyone who sees you and you can be shot from either direction... and why is the terrain so flat and open on so many maps? 

Or it's the other extreme, narrow corridors where both teams end in a stalemate, spam smokes and explosives and when you try to push through, you have 10 guns pointed at you and you immediately die. 

The only map that I've actually liked and had fun on so far is Iwo Jima on Conquest. There was enough cover, I could choose engagement distances and move around somewhat freely. Everything else was either terrible or serviceable at best.  

If you enjoy the maps in 2042, good for you. I'm not here to criticize you; I just wanted to ask if you, who know the game better, could recommend maps and game modes that you think are well-designed and enjoyable for someone like me.",False,/r/battlefield2042/comments/1mym3g3/the_best_maps_in_2042/,battlefield2042,1756009251.0,7,0.83,Question

The game looks very crispy, you know the textures are on point, the animations are gorgeous, but the visual clarity of ALL of that goes down the gutter on all the maps I played in the Beta because of the aggressive filters over them all. Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.

I'm eagerly awaiting BF6 however I saw the trailer for HLLV pop up on my feed and it looks awesome. The environment, theme, vehicles and weapons look very fun.

I know nothing about HLL whatsoever but I was thinking I might get HLLV and play it alongside BF6.

So, how does a typical HLL round play out? What sort of weapons are mainly used? I understand it's more of a milsim so I'm assuming it's generally a 1-2 shot kill and guns are almost always used in semi auto? How do the game modes work? Are tanks etc. very strong?

What sort of things should I keep in mind coming from Battlefield? 

I'm very keen to give this game a go.

MGS Delta sai logo logo e j√° temos benchmarks ruins do game. Sofrendo pra rodar em √≥timas GPUs (tipo a RTX 4060) e nos consoles de mesa (PS5 e PS5 PRO). Esse era um dos jogos que eu tava mais hypando pra jogar no lan√ßamento e agora toda a vontade se foi por causa da pregui√ßa cr√¥nica do desenvolvedor de querer otimizar o jogo corretamente. 

Outros exemplos: TESIV Oblivion Remastered. Como j√° podem ver pela minha flair, meu hardware, sim, √© de entrada, especialmente em 2025. Por√©m, consigo rodar muitos jogos em qualidade alta sem suar. Red Dead 2, RE4 Remake (naquele preset priorizar qualidade), AC Mirage, BF6, entre outros. TODOS ESSES graficamente muito mais impressionantes que Oblivion. E ainda assim, depois de 4 meses de lan√ßamento, o jogo continua injog√°vel na minha m√°quina. Engasgos, ghosting, input lag, bugs que quebram o jogo, etc. Este era o jogo que eu mais queria jogar esse ano.

A√≠ que eu me pergunto: em que momento se tornou aceit√°vel pagar 70 d√≥lares em jogos incompletos? Em que momento ficamos de cabe√ßa abaixada pra desenvolvedoras que n√£o tem a m√≠nima vontade de ao menos trabalhar em fazer pelo menos os reflexos da √°gua, vidro etc sem recorrer ao Ray Tracing, que, apesar de impressionante visualmente, √© invi√°vel pra 70, 80% dos jogadores de PC?

Like the option best because it would allow me to do Lenovo's advanced insurance for the 4 year care plan. But no Guaranteed shipping date and from some reviews the shipping can be delayed as its a build to order. Says ships within 6-9 days.

Reason I like this option is it is currently available to order and delivery is within the week but no option for a extended warranty. From what I've read ram is expandible to at least 24gb ram according to ASUS website.

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.

I know that there are ""night"" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?

The only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this. Idk, seems like a cool experience the devs could create, and I haven't really seen this in any other multiplayer game, except maybe Tarkov but that's almost an other genre.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myjik1/are_we_ever_gonna_get_an_actual_night_map/,Battlefield,1756000927.0,5,0.8,Discussion

The Funny thing is in CSM Works good (Because is the Load Default) but after Activate Secure (Standard), Reset, Get into Windows, Do Things or nothing and later Reset/Shut Down and Start, it Stuck on the Logo and Can't get on Boot Option, Setup Option, nothing. 
Only thing I can do is Open the Case and use the Clear CMOS Button (God dammit the Genius who has this idea of making this on the Mobo AND NOT OUTSIDE/BACK the Mobo) and get in to Bios to Load Default Because of I don't do that... It Will Stuck Again on Next Reboot Because the Secure Boot is Still Activated.

Some Idea why is this Happen?

Bios is On Last Update (F15) and the Windows 11 Partition is in GPT

EDIT: Partially Fixed

Seems to be a BUG in the Bios F12 to LAST F15 apparently, If I disable CSM It will Boot Once but next time nope so need to forcing Clear CMOS and Load Default. 
It will happen whether you activate it or not the Secure Boot.

The Only Solution I found was to ""Update"" to BIOS F11 (Nov 07, 2018), last bios wit Secure Boot working because the Next One (F12, Mar 15, 2019) to last one just had that Bug appareantly

After that I have Secure Boot activated and everything Ok... Too Bad there's no Resizable-BAR because was implemented on F15b :'D

Quick question as im fighting multiple ideas in my head and not sure what to do. 

So im currently running RTX3070 | Ryzen 5600x | 16Gb ram | 850w evga g2 | asus b550- F 

I really want to upgrade few bits to better run games at 1440p - specifically BF6 when it launches in October

Should i sell the PC as a whole and build brand new AM5 build (posted on marketplace for. Bragain price ¬£670)

Or sell GPU and CPU and upgrade to 5700x3D / 9070  and remain within the end of life AM4 for a bit longer 

Or sell everything separately but keep PSU /SSD and go ahead with AM5 ?

I'm not entirely computer savvy when it comes to this stuff so a simple yes or no answer is fine!

I currently have an Asus tuf model FX505DD- BQ145T. Ive owned for roughly for 5ish years.

I upgraded the ram to 16gb and installed a secondary 1tb SSD in the spare slot.

I've never have any issues with it apart from the fans going wild with moderate use.

I now do a bit of content creation for a game I play which I record and stream IRL overhead gameplay with a camera + elgato camlink and OBS.

Sometimes these streams will go for 10+ hours non-stop as we are steaming card game events in store.

The last time I used my Asus (as it's a spar machine for me), about 8 hours in we had some issues with the stream dropping in frame rates which I'm assuming we may have reached the limitations of the Asus tuf.

I found an Asus tuf on clearance for around $1500AUD (FA506NCR-HN016W) or what I'm assuming is a more budget model (FA506NCR-HN040W) for $1100AUD.

Is it worth upgrading or are there some further modifications I can make to my current model that will be sufficient for what I use it for?

Also if I wanted to run game like fortnite, rivals, helldiver's, bf6 etc, would this still suffice? (I'm assuming not)

My budget is tight at the moment so which option is the best:

1. Buy the 9060xt and wait for the CPU upgrade

2. Buy the CPU upgrade such as the r7 5800xt and then wait to upgrade GPU.

3. Wait until I can buy both because the bottleneck would be too limiting. 

This would be 1080p gaming. I don't care that much about 4k or 1440p and I prioritize FPS and the overall feel/smoothness but don't want to have to use low settings for single player games.

They worked perfectly from ranged, to medium engagements to packing an absolute punch in CQB when things got hot.

M14/21/39 EBR has been my favorite DMR in any game that features it, and BF6 was the first game in my entire library where I actually hated it. It was just awful to work with.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hyped about and why:

* **Escalation mode** ‚Äì this could be a *really* fun new experience. If it‚Äôs dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.
* **Maps** ‚Äì the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. I‚Äôm especially hyped for Egypt ‚Äì exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.
* **Classes + weapon progression** ‚Äì finally we‚Äôll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.
* **Portal** ‚Äì if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, that‚Äôs going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.
* **Campaign** ‚Äì I‚Äôm genuinely happy we‚Äôre getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.
* **Battle Royale** ‚Äì this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BF‚Äôs scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.
* **Battle Pass** ‚Äì not much to say yet, but if it‚Äôs not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, it‚Äôll work fine.
* **Ranked mode** ‚Äì I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.

Overall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they don‚Äôt screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.

I think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myehur/why_i_think_battlefield_6_has_a_really_strong/,Battlefield,1755986794.0,8,0.56,Battlefield 6

So just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.

Played the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good 

 I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify 

So BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other? Lmk",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myd1p2/which_has_worse_maps_bfv_or_2042/,Battlefield,1755983172.0,16,0.36,Discussion

I enjoy anime, computers and some retro gaming(JRPGs). I'm always down to just chill and watch the sunset on RUST or climb the ranks in Apex. I'm in the eastern time zone and mostly play evening hours 7ish-12am.

Here are some games I've recently played and my takes on them.

BF6 beta - can't wait till October!

Dune Awakening - I had tons of fun but felt that endgame needs some TLC to keep replayability.

Apex legends - I'm a day one apex player that's slightly above average at best.

The Finals - I enjoy the direction this game has gone since release.

Stardew Valley - I just recently picked this up and don't know why cause it's so fun.

1myakrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,,4,Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging,ystolai,False,True,False,,False,"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50‚Äì60 FPS or higher. The point is, it‚Äôs not just the icon showing up ‚Äî when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don‚Äôt register on the enemy.

In reality, this isn‚Äôt exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.

This ‚Äúphantom lag‚Äù happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can‚Äôt keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning ‚Äî along with real gameplay lag.

# The solution I found

What pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:

* **Plugged in**:
   * SPL = 30W
   * SPPT = 30W
   * FPPT = 35W
* **On battery**:
   * SPL = 25W
   * SPPT = 25W
   * FPPT = 25W

With this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay anymore.

# About packet loss

I was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  
Upgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference ‚Äî now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.

# Why this works

1. **Fixed power delivery** ‚Üí prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.
2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** ‚Üí offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.
   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.
   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.

üëâ In short:  
Stabilize your **power profiles** \+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally.",False,/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,ROGAlly,1755977209.0,6,0.83,Discussion

Ive roughly followed youtubers settings guides like silk and ghost however ive made some adjustments that i find easier personally these are as follows

Instead of pitch up/down being on L Ctrl and Spacebar ive put them on w and s respectively basically swapping them (with it also bound to mouse for strafing ground targets)

 I've also been using roll on a and d rather than mouse and yaw is on mouse instead of a and d

Ive found these inputs easier for me to work with as im still youngling in fps gaming with a kb+m but im curious if any experienced players think im shooting myself in the foot with these changes as ive gotten to an average level i am really looking to get back to where i was at a minimum

The beta felt fantastic. The pace was modern, frantic, and rewarding for aggressive, skilled play. Slowing everything down feels like a reactionary move to cater to a more passive, campy playstyle that has plagued other shooters.

This was our chance to have a true, fast-paced modern Battlefield. Slowing it down makes it feel more like a sluggish mil-sim than the all-out warfare sandbox we love. Please, DICE, don't sand down the edges that made the beta feel so fresh and engaging. Revert these changes.

Weekly missons can give you a total of 55 token which is equivalent to 5.5 levels. So total of weekly missions tokens would be 495 which is equivalent to 49.5 levels.
To farm faster in the game here is some tips:
1. Play conquest but play on close quarter mode where it's infantry based maps. You will be farming like there's no tomorrow 
2. Play the game during weekends due to XP boost weekend event. Playing during the weekends will give you 100% XP boost which could not only increase your level but faster to get the skins you want.
3. Play Support class to level up faster. By provide ammo, revives and suppress fire your your team and squadmates would give you more XP and lots of ribbons.

I‚Äôm looking for some upgrade advice and could use your input.

My current specs:
	‚Ä¢	CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
	‚Ä¢	GPU: Asus RTX 3070 8Gb
	‚Ä¢	Motherboard: MSI B450 A ProMax
	‚Ä¢	RAM: 16GB DDR4 (speed not sure, probably 3000 MHz or lower)

I mostly play Shooter on 1440p (Cs2) and Ive noticed that in the Bf6 Beta, which I'm looking forward to, my FPS isn‚Äôt as good as I‚Äôd like. From what I‚Äôve read, Battlefield tends to be CPU-heavy, so I suspect the 3600 might be my bottleneck.

My questions:
	‚Ä¢	Should I just upgrade the CPU (thinking about the Ryzen 7 5800X3D since it‚Äôs still AM4)?
	‚Ä¢	Or would it be smarter to also swap the motherboard to a B550 (and maybe new RAM later) for more features and ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù?

I‚Äôm not super well off financially, so ideally I‚Äôd like the best price-to-performance upgrade without rebuilding my whole systems.

Do you have any recommends?

Look at the phantom edition skins (just a start, not inherently bad) and the gun skins in the 2042 free pass (which are pretty worrying). I think it‚Äôs fine to add these skins as long as we can choose not to see them on other people if we don‚Äôt want to. I think I can speak for most people here when I say I don‚Äôt wanna see that sht. I understand it‚Äôs not going to be anywhere near as bad as call of booty, but just add a slider. We are supposed to be in an immersive warzone. Seeing a blacked out dude with red, blue, purple trim and brightly colored guns takes away from that immersion and realism in a sense. And this slider shouldn‚Äôt disable all skins, just show all the BASE skins. If a player you encounter is wearing a post-launch skin just make it so they are wearing a random base-game skin. (There‚Äôs PLENTY of cool camos for each character) I‚Äôve seen an argument on the cod side of things about how not as many people would buy skins if everyone wasn‚Äôt forced to see them which means less money, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a significant enough argument nor do l think it‚Äôs fair at all.

People have every right not to play the mode or dislike it, but to hope it fails just because you don't like it. This makes no sense at all. 

EA has tried in the past to create a Battle Royale mode for Battlefield, in this case, Firestorm in BFV. However, it failed because it wasn't free, and no one who buys BF wants to play that, just the classic experience. BF2042's Hazard Zone mode was an extraction mode, but it failed because BF2042 is...BF2042 , so the mode didn't even have a chance to do anything.

Like every game company's goal, it wants to please existing players and attract new ones. BF6 is doing this; most people like it, and it's attracting a lot of people (especially those fleeing from BO7/Warzone). So a free mode also has this purpose, and if it's successful, it will attract players to buy the paid game. 

And this is very good for people who can't afford to pay $70 for a game and for people in third-world countries, which have lower purchasing power and a low-value currency. 

Warzone attracted a lot of people, but it also has some problems that Ripple Effect (the studio that will develop the mode) can't repeat:

- Integrating multiple games into a single mode. Warzone has about 200 weapons, and that's impossible to balance.

- Poor anti-cheat. 

- The game lacks its own identity; they change the movement and gunplay depending on the year's COD. 

- It's listened to by many streamers and content creators. 

- The game's philosophy has become basically a giant TDM. 

- Colored skins, even with the argument that it is a free game, harm the immersion and the purpose of the game.

- Lack of content after launch

We have little information about the mode; we don't know if it will be integrated into BF6 or how it will play. But we'll have BF Labs testing. My guess is after BF6's release; they don't want this to dampen the game's hype. 

There's a thought: if the mode is a success, EA will prioritize the free-to-play mode over the classic experience. Well, then, give me the lottery ticket, since you're predicting the future. We don't know what will happen and I think it's very unlikely.

But if Ripple Effect can create a mode that rewards team play, more tactical movement (not Milsim), sophisticated gunplay instead of a laser beam, has a lot of content, and maintains a more military feel, they already have a significant advantage over their competitors.

And that would be very good for the franchise and the community.

That's my opinion on the matter. You have every right to disagree.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1my39lj/battle_royale_vs_battlefield_community_my_opinion/,Battlefield,1755960161.0,23,0.68,Battlefield 6

Yes, the hate it gets are mostly justified, but what are some of the things (big or small) you think 2042 actually did right or you just like?

  
For examples here are some things i personally really dig:     

\-The conquest ""sector"" system, its much easier to disrupt enemy majority or even turn the table around without needing to actually control more objectives than enemy. I think this has a lot of potentials to create some really interesting match outcomes when implemented well in certain maps.      

\-Skipping revive doesn't drain your timer is a welcome qol detail to me. In bfv and bf6 there are many times i cant reach and revive my squadmates in time because they skipped half their timer before i could tag them. The 2042 system makes it more streamlined for medics because basically all the people waiting for revives now have a much more consistent timer.        

\-Hourglass's sandstorm is not only visually stunning, i think its also the first time they finally find the balance between gimmick and gameplay. It only blocks your view for the first few seconds and it takes no time to return to sunny days. Making it more of a cool intermission event and don't feel like it could last half a match like in Sinai deserts.        

\-The announcers are underrated imo, coming from bf1 siri and bfv. I think its really cool that we now have multiple announcers working together as a team themselves, (i especially like the detail that sometimes announcer tells you how the match is going on because you overheard the commander asking for status report on the radio, not just because commander feels the need to tell you personally like in most other games).

I've watched several people stream the games before but am a new player to the franchise.

I did the intro conquest mission and tried queueing on 64 player conquest map, but the count maybe goes up to 3 and then drops back down to 1/64.

Is there a way to search for fuller lobbies or servers that have more active players?

Do I need to level up more to find matches with more people in it or how can I play this game?

I tried one match with bots when the lobby stayed empty for 20 mins, but I'm thinking of refunding and maybe rather getting something else as I wanted to play PVP FPS BF style game, like Battlebit. I enjoyed it!

I'm also not sure if I'll be spending money at the premium price point of BF6, if this is how low the interest in Battlefield is in my region, without any server browser or wider matchmaking. I don't mind playing at 150ms ping or anything below 250ms, if it means I get to play. But this game does not seem to give that option.

I mostly play for fun, not competitive.

Opinions are different for everyone but I feel I need to state this as BF2042 was always highly criticized. 
Let me start by saying I‚Äôve played and own all BF‚Äôs, my favorite being BF3. 
We all know the comment ‚ÄúBF4 is just BF3 but more polished‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be more untrue. 
BF3 had much more enjoyable maps, assignments and core mechanics. 
Not only that, but the graphics and overall visuals / color palette hold up better. BF4 also tends to have buggy textures and overall worse graphics. 
But let‚Äôs focus this thread on the comparison between BF4 and 2042. BF4 suffers from a horrible netcode and lag. I can‚Äôt even state how many times I was running behind cover while shot and got killed while I was already Ls‚Äùsafe‚Äù. Hitmark detection in 4 is bad. Also too many times when I see an enemy appear in my screen for a split second, I‚Äôm already dead. I recorded multiple clips to analyze this phenomenon and I was right. Maybe because I have extremely low ping (1000mbps fibre glass internet) and the opponent or BF server is laggy.  
Whatever the reason, it‚Äôs really shitty. Combat and gunplay become really annoying. 
2042 on the other hand is buttery smooth and a 1:1 representation of how your brain perceives things. It‚Äôs just much more up to date and modern feeling. 
Another thing I can‚Äôt stand about bf4 is how the maps in my opinion mostly suck. Everyone is wild about shanghai, but in my eyes it‚Äôs just some skyscrapers and some roads with a bridge.. don‚Äôt get me started on 24/7 golmud maps. Golmud is a shit map, there I said it. 
I actually believe that 2042 maps are more enjoyable than a lot of bf4 maps (inb4 downvotes, idc). 
Spearhead gives me this very open feeling and gives me windows xp fever dream vibes. Orbital has an actual rocket launch during the battle. Overall I think the maps are a little blend but still give a lot of play room for different tactics and approaches. And they look gorgeous. 
The gadgets in 2042 give the player a shitton of cool new ways to battle the enemy. For example using a guided rocket to take down a chopper with your controller is much more interesting and effective than just aiming an igla, waiting for the aircraft to deploy flares and then try again..
I do hate the whole specialist characters in 2042 but the gear is better. 

If I wanted the old school BF maps and vibes I‚Äôll just play my baby BF3. BF4 just seems like a very confused release with bad maps.. I mean there are some good dlc maps like dragon valley but no server rolls these maps. It‚Äôs mostly flood, golmud, metro etc. 
Bf4 graphics, lag and netcode are also horrible imo. 
Not to forget that the game became really sweaty. Tons of vehicle campers, people using team resources like jets to get their asses up a skyscraper just to snipe and be useless etc‚Ä¶

Again, this was not meant as a war between the two games, but more to show people 2042 is actually really good (now) and I couldn‚Äôt imagine going back to bf4. 

To sum it all up; gameplay and gunplay wise, 2042 is much more correct and smooth. Combat is satisfying and more fair. Requires skills, less (or no) netcode failure. Maps in my eyes are very interesting. Serene, futuristic but not over the top. People call it a walking simulator. That‚Äôs really a far stretch and I love them more than the maps we‚Äôve seen in the bf6 beta. I love the gadgets giving you unique ways to play. Graphics are very refreshing and high quality. 

The reason for this thread was primarily to encourage more people to try out 2042. It received so much criticism while it‚Äôs actually a smooth, crisp, intelligent and fair Battlefield game. Especially wanted to put an emphasis on this since a lot of people are on BF4, just like I was, not knowing better. But in retrospect, BF4 is just a buggy, laggy ugly mess.

I know the 9800X3D is designed to run hot (90‚Äì95¬∞C is within spec) and my Cinebench R24 multi score (~1475) shows there‚Äôs no throttling or performance loss. But I‚Äôm still not quite happy with the aio performance‚Ä¶

My setup:

	‚Ä¢	Ryzen 7 9800X3D, PBO -25 with +150 MHz (pbo motherboard)

	‚Ä¢	MSI Edge Ti B850 (latest BIOS installed)

	‚Ä¢	Corsair iCUE LINK Titan 360 RX LCD, top-mounted in a Corsair 3500X

‚Ä¢	Previously: Corsair H150i Elite Capellix (front-mounted intake) in an iCUE 465X ‚Üí ~86¬∞C max on CB23/24 before the pump died this sum

	‚Ä¢	Thermal paste: tried both the pre-applied paste and Noctua NT-H2 (reapplied twice) ‚Üí same results
	‚Ä¢	  Corsair dominator tunned 6200 C28 RAM

	‚Ä¢	MSI 5070 Ti Gaming Trio undervolted to 3000 MHz @ 0.950 V (60-65C with low fans rpm in games)

	‚Ä¢	Airflow: 3x RX120 side intake, 1x RX140 bottom intake, 1x RX120 rear exhaust, 3x RX120 radiator top exhaust 

	‚Ä¢	Ambient: ~27‚Äì30¬∞C (Paris, during summer, top floor under the roof, no AC)

	‚Ä¢	Liquid temps: from 35C after cold boot to 40-41 max. 

Temps:
	‚Ä¢	Cinebench R23/R24 ‚Üí spikes to 90+¬∞C within seconds, peaks ~94¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	BF6 beta (40vs40 large maps) ‚Üí ~70¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	CS2 (1280x1024, 500 FPS) ‚Üí ~60‚Äì65¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	Idle ‚Üí 46‚Äì50¬∞C

Here‚Äôs what confuses me:
When I start Cinebench, the CPU hits 90¬∞C almost instantly (within a few seconds), but the liquid temp barely rises and usually stays around 38‚Äì40¬∞C. That makes me wonder if the heat transfer from the IHS to the coldplate is happening correctly. If the cooler was saturated, I‚Äôd expect the liquid to climb much higher, but it doesn‚Äôt.

The pump is fine (shows ~3000 rpm in iCUE, liquid temps stable), so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a pump issue. Since paste doesn‚Äôt change anything (stock or NT-H2 gave identical results), I‚Äôm starting to suspect contact quality with the IHS, even though I made sure to mount it properly and tightened it in a cross pattern.

So I‚Äôm trying to figure out if:
	1.	It‚Äôs just the ambient heat (27‚Äì30¬∞C room temp vs 20‚Äì21¬∞C for others)
	2.	The TITAN 360 RX is simply underperforming vs other 360mm AIOs
	3.	Or if my AIO contact/coldplate quality might be the issue

I could always cap PBO to lower PPT, but I was hoping a 360mm AIO would handle this CPU without needing this.

Any recommendations, tips, or similar experiences with the TITAN 360 RX would be super appreciated!",False,/r/Corsair/comments/1mxwihk/9800x3d_titan_360_rx_lcd_peaking_at_94c_in/,Corsair,1755939786.0,33,0.98,Help

I am nearing my wit's end, so I have come here to hopefuly gather some wise wizardry. Here's the story

2 weeks ago I installed Battlefield 6 open Beta. It required me to enable Safe Boot ; for that I had to update my BIOS. Then I had to update my GPU drivers, which I did via the AMD software, as usual. No other changes were made, and I was able to play the game for the weekend.

In the following week and up until now, i've had multiple BSOD that are have a rather unpredictable timing : they can happen on the window login screen, or I can browse for hours on Firefox without any crash, go take a shit, and then boom, BSOD while the PC is idle.

The BSOD have a different message each time, but it's always a ""visually glitched"" BSOD (think 4 BSOD on the upper screen, and a ""mosaic of what was on the screen before the crash"" on the bottom).

Here is what I have tried so far :

\- Restore to a ""before BF6"" => no effect on BSOD

\- clean uninstall and reinstall of AMD drivers => no effect on BSOD

\- updated BIOS to the latest non-beta version => no effect on BSOD

\- ran memtest86 on my only RAM stick = no error detected (2 pass)

\- ran Window's memory diag tool => no error detectedf (full test)

\- ran windows repair tools (chdsk, dism, sfc) => no effect on BSOD

\- reinstalled Windows (while keeping my data, not the clean slate reinstall) => no effect on BSOD

\- ran Verifier to check non-window drivers => 2 crashes so far, one a few minutes after boot, the other a few hours after boot.

\-Ran Windows antivirus on full scan => found only 3 old trojans i've had for years.

Up until two days ago i was using WhoCrashed to read the DMP files, but it was not very helful, as the crash types are all over the place. Now i'm using BlueScreenviewer and it's consistenly targeting ""ntoskrnl.exe+3fd510"", which if i'm understanding correctly, is Windows ""master driver"", although it could be not directly linked to this, but rather to something it's trying to access/use (right ?).

I have not done anything yet on the hardware side yet.

I don't know what more to do to find the root of the issue. Can you guys help me ? (i've had 2 more BSOD while writing this post)

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QoQb4Lov7Y) by MoiDawg sums it up very nicely. DICE has transplanted BF3's Rush formula into what we now call Breakthrough, but this killed all the fun of what Rush used to be.

For example, in the Beta NATO Support and Pax Armata Recon were female soldiers. Will their skins be all female? Same for the male soldiers, will their skins only be male always?  Or would the skins determine the gender of the soldier, with the default skins being as they are?
