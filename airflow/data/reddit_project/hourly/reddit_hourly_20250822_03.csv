1mww701,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mww701/kd_matters/,,0,K/D Matters,oldcrivens,False,True,False,,False,"Ever since the BF6 beta came out, I’ve seen a ton of people both on Reddit and on other social media sites saying “these cod kids think k/d matters… it doesn’t” or something along those lines. I don’t know why people say that because it’s 100% not true. “Playing the objective” involves killing the other team. It’s actually one of the most important parts of playing the objective. Going 10-15 but having 10 captures (where all of them consist of you zerging from point to point with 10 other players) doesn’t mean you’re actually helping the team. 

The infantry players who are going 40-15 with 4 captures are probably far more useful. To get 30+ kills you have be in positions where there’s a ton of enemy players to shoot, which is always around or in between objectives. Getting that squad wipe on a squad who has a beacon in a good spot, or a flank that allows your team to push is actually influencing the game, results in a higher k/d, and is what helps your team win. 

It’s totally fine to play casually, it’s a casual game, but saying you shouldn’t care about k/d when playing to win is just dumb. You can’t win from the respawn screen. ",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mww701/kd_matters/,Battlefield,1755834469.0,13,0.44,Discussion

Já completei os requisitos dessa arma a muito tempo, já liberei outros anexos depois desse, mas esse não libera.  
Vi post de até 4 anos atras sobre esse bug e até hoje sem solução, entrei em contato com o suporte e parece que estou conversando com robos que respondem em prompts sem a minima intenção real de ajudar.

Alguem já achou um modo de resolver?

Cause it got refunded within 2 hours/ 4 Online games.

Where do I start? 

\#1) Ping/Server issues.... I played 4 online games, all over 60+ ping (I get 20-30 in EVERY other game I play, even less with some like Fortnite/OW). The passing was delayed, the animations were SO emphasized, and I felt like my players were playing in Ice the whole time... Which I felt I had very little control over my defenders.... Which leads me to point #2

\#2) Defense and Defenders.... I have NEVER had an easier time passing 97 VVD then I did today. All 4 games had SEVERAL goals within 30 minutes. I had one game.... 13-9.... another 12-5, and another 12-6 (all wins btw, still didnt have fun)....This is coming from past games where I pride myself in defending, but no matter WHAT setting I did... I felt like I could not defend AT ALL... and my Ops were the same way

\#3) WHY ARE THEY GIVING US TOTW 97's TO TEST THE GAME??? the whole point is to play the game with low level cards like we would at the start..... Why give me 99 Pace Mbappe that can run around all of the team without anyone stopping him? and that leads to #4

\#4) Dribbling and Offense is CRRAAZZZYYYY strong.... the fact that there was a goal in EVERY GAME within the first kickoff was nuts, legit every game started with a kickoff goal. The ""run down the line cut back"" meta is still there, dribbling felt WAY too good on a player like Hansen, she shouldnt just R1 run and sprint around the whole pitch....

All and All, I still see the SAME glaring issues that plagued FC25 and I simply cannot put myself thru another year of this game. SO glad I got a chance to save myself the pain, onto BF6 and Borderlands 4 :)

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof.
