1mx8u8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx8u8h/fun_conspiracy_theory_wip_bf56_classes_are/,,0,Fun conspiracy theory (WIP): BF56 classes are inspired by most played BF2042 specialists,GerhardKoepke,False,True,False,,False,"**Listen, this is probably a brain fart, so don't get all riled up but rather join the fun conspiracy theorizing. :D**

I was thinking about what impact the BF2042 specialists might have had in deciding what the classes in BF6 can and can't do. What were the most played specialists and how were they played? I don't really have this info, with the exception of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/14azz1t/falk_most_played_specialist_and_some_other_stats/) stat from 2 years ago, where Falck is the most played specialist, but assault is the most played ""class"".

So I just took the liberty and came up with my theory of of thin air, supported by playing this damn game since launch (rank S205 as of right now):

**BF6 Assault**

*Most likely inspired by:* Sundance and Mackay

*Reasoning:* Sundance is probably a really popular specialists in general, but probably one of the two most picked assaults, due to their explosive capabilities (and the wingsuit, sure). Smart grenades, normal grenades, grenade launcher - you could have it all. And the assault class has the epi pen as well. Mackay is a fan favourite due to his grapple hook, getting him access to places and angles they are not expected - Sundance can do similar things with their wing suit of course. And by using any weapon and also the plus system, high skilled players can probably react to so many different situations at a push of a button (not me, though).

*Effect on BF6:* Grenade launchers, grenades, two primary weapons (maybe with underbarrel grenade launchers in the future), the epi pen thing and soon a ladder to reach places you are not expected. What shall I say more?



**BF6 Engineer**

*Most likely inspired by:* Crawford (?!)

*Reasoning:* I think Boris is probably played more, due to the auto-aim and auto-spot turret, but something like this is (so far) not part of BF6, I chose Crawford, but only because he is able to carry 1 additional rocket. Maybe someone else has a better theory.

*Effect on BF6:* In the beta, we were starting with 5 RPGs (maybe even stingers, but I am not positive on that one). But I think the overall effect was not that big, as engineers are a well defined role anyway. 



**BF6 Support**

*Most likely inspired by:* Falck (duh!)

*Reasoning:* Falck is THE self-sufficiant hero character and probably still the most played specialist in BF2042 - she is my main and not only because I am German as well. Reviving everyone from your team, healing yourself and others and dropping ammo as well - if that isn't the support class in BF6?! She was actually what made me think of this ridiculous theory. :D

*Effect on BF6:* Unlike in former (non-2042) Battlefield titles, where you were either supplying ammo OR health depending on the class you chose, you can now supply all of it with one big old bag. Yes, this big old bag is pretty much Falck (sorry Falck...you old bag).

  
**BF6 Recon**

*Most likely inspired by:* Casper and maybe Paik

*Reasoning:* Casper has his drone he can use to spot players and put C5 on and we've already seen one in the BF6 multiplayer trailer. But more importantly, Casper and Paik both have fairly similar traits with the proximity sensor and the wall hack - you can (in theory) find and kill unobservant players.

*Effect on BF6:* I would not be surprised if something similar to the proximity sensor or wall hack thing will be introduced. DICE already said, they want the recon to be the silent killer (additionally to the reconnaissance): being behind enemy lines, being aware of them at all times and killing them unnoticed - sounds like a constant spot or proximity sensor/wall hack would fit right in (I hope not, though). In the beta, you were already 3D spotted by anyone looking in your general direction and auto-spotted by recons just aiming at you. By enabling the compass, you would also see the spotted enemies relative to your direction. It's just a small step to the proximity sensor then. Maybe this will be limited to and/or even enhanced for the recon (e.g. showing the rough direction of unspotted enemies nearby, like in Battlefront). Together with the normal drone we've seen in the trailer and the UAV, which is just an auto-spotting drone anyway, the recon would be a walking motion sensor ball.  
Personally, I'm not sure what this means to the classic recon with a sniper rifle, if you are encouraged to get up close and personal all the time. And then you don't even have a respawn beacon.

Indie devs face their own issues and are just in a different ball park for me

Anyways prime examples for me: wildgate and BF6

Both had pretty great reception, but because of the price barrier the player counts will absolutely remain lower than what they should be at. Add in that you need to not only pay to buy the game, but then your paying for cosmetics on top of that, as well as time gating weapons and skills that people wanna use straight away to make the overall experience better

Anyways devs seem to have their head in their asses in general right now, being greedy enough to sell skins after the initial purchase is bonkers, what happened to FTP, then buy the skins? Not buy the game, and then the skins too. If I'm buying the game I sure as shit better earn the skins in game too

Anyways, simple ways to launch this game into the stratosphere:

1. FTP model, pay for hero skins, pay for hideout skins. Look at league and Dota, FTP moba's that have stood the test of time with this exact model

2. Different ques: casuals want to play against casuals and sweats wanna sweat with other sweats. Que time doesn't matter unless it's 5+ minutes, just give quality matches. Obviously the playtest can be different, but I think they should lean into it when the game gets released

Dark and darker is a great example of why casual and competitive cannot mix together. The skill difference is one thing, but to add in knowledge gaps on top of it makes the mix ques just no fun for anyone. Noobs need a place to learn PvP, casual ques are that mid ground before competitive but harder than playing against bots

That's basically it, a FTP model is honestly all that's needed and I think this game would get the traffic easily. Add in the paid cosmetics and there's your profit, make it so you can also earn the skins in game over a decent grind (league does it well) and you're absolutely cooking
