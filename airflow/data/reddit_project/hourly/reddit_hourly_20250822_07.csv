The third-person animations in BF2042 are exactly the same as the ones you see in first-person, they are not modeled differently as in previous games, a detail that I love!

In a video posted by the aforementioned user, BF6's animations are equally good, they need more polish (example: the arms when the soldier have an LMG, I've seen that sometimes the arms go completely through the model, i see this when i played the beta ).

This might be a hot take, but ***Specialist personalities.*** Their voice acting is well done and I love how much of a massive variety of voice lines each of them have, for so many different situations and call-outs. Some of them even respond to each other specifically in certain contexts (I had an interaction earlier where Mackay acknowledged a Defend order from Dozer when I pinged his command.) They all sound cool, well-made, and highly characteristic. Mackay is silly but no-nonsense when it matters, Casper is cool-headed and austere, Boris is just fucking awesome. I just like them a lot and I will genuinely miss them.

To be clear, the super cringe voice lines in the game's early lifespan sucked. There's no argument against that - they were ***bad*** and detracted from the experience immensely. However, the characterization of the Specialists and their interactions shined after dev tweaks over time. I always look forward to hearing their one liner whenever I return to the main menu. I've really grown to like them and I'm quite comfortable with them; I'll miss them in BF6. I like the faceless goon aesthetic too, don't get me wrong, but you can still have a masked elite soldier with a bit of characteristic.

2. Casper's drone. Sometimes when I'm sniping, the battleline shifts and I'm no longer in a solid position to provide marksman support but it would take too long for me to shift into a new, better position to help out. So instead I can just pull up the drone and mark the enemies on the point so my allies know what they're getting into. I also enjoy using it to scout ahead of my path to make sure I won't get spotted before getting into a good sniping position - practically guaranteeing that I'm always going to reach a spot where I'll be able to help my team. The drone's versatility is something I've come to bring the full potential out of, and I enjoy it a lot. Not having such a helpful, versatile tool is going to be sad.

3. Angel's versatility. Because of his kit, I can bring a medical pack and support the team and myself in a multitude of different ways. He inherently provides ammo and gadget refills, he can heal if you bring a medpack, and he can revive anybody. I played BF4 for 16 hours (it was fun) and I always felt like I was missing Angel's robust kit. He's great offensively with low ammo-economy weapons and grenades due to ease of self-supply, and he's great at holding a position with your team thanks to his ability to resupply others fully, and (optionally) heal. He's a great comfort pick and I'll miss him.

4. Mackay's grapple hook. I loved using it in intelligent, strategic, and tactical ways. Getting the jump on snipers, getting into better flanking positions, etc. I always felt rewarded for using it well and I'll miss it when I play BF6.

5. Some of the skins are incredible. Mackay's CoD Ghost-style skin (released very early in the game's lifespan) is still one of my most-used, favorite skins on any character in the game.

  
6. Call-ins. Ranger was always fun to play with. He's gotten me plenty of kills, helped me cap a lot of points, and each Specialist even has voice lines for his commands. They didn't \*have\* to code commands for him, but they did, allowing players who want to use him tactically the ability to do so. 



Heli or Jet bothering you? Nobody on your team dealing with it, thinking someone else will do it? Call in a Wildcat and fuck it up. 



Is your team sieging? Got a tank in the garage? Drop it in and roll out.



Call-ins made the battle experience a lot smoother, more consistent, and more fun imo.

In closing, I hope this post shows people that somehow believe 2042 to have no redeeming qualities are very wrong, and I hope that at least some of these qualities will be reimplemented in BF6 in some way or another. I know they're going for something different, but these aspects of 2042 can still be translated into a more grounded setting.",False,/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mwzxgv/things_im_going_to_miss_from_2042_going_into_bf6/,Battlefield6,1755847528.0,3,0.27,Discussion
