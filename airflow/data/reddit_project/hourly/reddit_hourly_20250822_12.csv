The SVK was the only gun I played with.  I tried the M39 during the first weekend, and I thought it was farely weak. I couldn't find a good shooting rhythm, and got a lot of bloom.  The small map size wasn't ideal for a DMR, but it should still be playable. I think they need to be two shot kills out to two hundred meters. They need to be able to effectively counter snipers, and semi auto  is at such a disadvantage to automatic fire that it needs ro make up for that with power. 



I had limited time with the gun, so perhaps I just need more practice, but my current impression is that the gun, and maybe the class, needs a buff. ",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx5ob7/bf6what_did_you_about_the_m39/,Battlefield,1755867130.0,5,1.0,Battlefield 6

BF6 literally looks like old BF3/BF4 with updated graphics. Maybe a pinch of the gunplay from BFV. Really ecstatic to see where this game goes, even if I don’t ever play it, or barely ever touch it. I’ve lost my gaming competitiveness years ago. MW2019 and BFV were my last shooters, and I’ve turned into a horrible player lol.

For example, the skins from the Phantom edition look cool, but I would change their camouflage texture. 

The set could include a unique soldier appearance and a collection of camouflages that can be used not only with this skin, but also with existing ones. Some of the camouflages could be made available through in-game events or achievements.

This would add more flexibility to customisation and make the process of obtaining skins more interesting.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx50kr/skins_for_soldiers/,Battlefield,1755865355.0,0,0.25,Battlefield 6

Played Vietnam after, then 2142, BF3, and later BF1 and BFV. The only BF I didn’t play was BF4, because it came out when I started law school. 

I downloaded it last night and…wow! One thing I love is the chat on PC. People can type and communicate in chat, and it’s so easy to play in a server and develop a connection to another player or squad that results in an online friend request and a new person to play with. 

I noticed in the BF6 beta, PC players couldn’t choose to only play with other PC players. I want that functionality bc I want the chat to be full (the text chat) and want to have the option to maximize my chances to meet people and add them on Steam. If Dice lets us choose to play with other PC players only, then I think that even without a server browser (which I want but don’t think we’ll get outside of Portal), I’ll be a happy man. 

Playing BF4 actually caused me to go ahead and buy BF6. I hated the BF6 maps but have faith Dice knows what they’re doing and will release maps that feature the vehicle combat and tactical, slower play that a lot of us love.
