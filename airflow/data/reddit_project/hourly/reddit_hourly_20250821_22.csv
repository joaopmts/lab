Game was great yesterday and now today every time I try to launch it no matter which way, even as admin it will not run. It will not get past the splash screen. Every solution I have looked up does not work. And apparently I’m not alone. All of this just to get a simple game to run and EA cannot get their crap together. First,  the whole boot ordeal with BF6, and now….this. Why do we need to be IT techs just to run a dang game?!
