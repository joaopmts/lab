As a cod fan that hardly enjoyed the last few ganes this looked the most original cod since mw2019 tbh. 

I get the hype for BF6 but what would cod need to do to compete with it? Release another moden era game? Another ww2 game? Cold war, gulf war? Been there done that.

I fully expected bo7 to be like mwiii, idk how treyarch did this but bo7 seems PACKED. 

On launch you have a coop linear campaign to finish, the endgame pve mode to unlock, 4 mastery camos for the canpaign

Open world zombies map, survival map, dead ops arcade 4.

Mp has 13 original maps and 3 bo2 remasters, 20v20 mode, maps looking vibrant and beautiful again, original streaks finally, original hud, no tac sprint and doors, wall jumping, unique field upgrades, overclock, specialist package, 4 mastery camos, weekly events, weapon and player prestiges.

This actually sounds amazing but somehow people are hating after getting eveything they asked for, reminder that previous cods launched with 8 mp maps like cw, or 16 remastered maps like mwiii, or vanguard launching with der anfang. We had it way worse

The Devs from BF6 have confirmed with Portal there will be a server browser. In Portal, you will find verified experiences and custom made experiences. Verified being DICE servers, custom made is by Players.

Let's not kid ourselves: who has ever used the game mode search option in BF3 / BF4? Nobody. Everybody used the server browser to find their own experience which fits best for oneself.

Why should open or closed really matter? In the end of the day, most of the players will either way just go into server browsers and filter whatever they want.

Same thing with 12v12 rush. You don't like it? Good, your opinion. But you can modify rush to be 32v32 at release in Portal, so I'm really not sure why ppl are arguing over this stuff? Can someone explain it to me?

This release literally gives us the most tools to make a badass custom player made experience in this franchises history with custom modes, custom modifiers like player count etc.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx307a/why_is_everyone_so_hung_up_on_open_or_closed/,Battlefield,1755859189.0,34,0.43,Battlefield 6
