1mwxh4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwxh4g/as_a_support_main_i_prefer_lmg_over_pdwsmg/,,5,"As a support main, I prefer LMG over PDW/SMG.",Lux-Fox,False,True,False,,False,"I'm a medic that tries to revive everyone I can and constantly put down kits and cover, so why would I prefer a LMG that people say is counter intuitive to use over an smg when I'm in the middle of battle? I have two points reasons that work for me, but I acknowledge that everyone has a different play style. 

1.  Smg preferred weapon means you have slightly better hip fire control. Hip fire control on an smg is already very easy to manage and it has a diminishing return after a certain point. However, if you're running an LMG, being able to run just as fast as everyone else when you're being a team player is crucial! Switching to a knife to keep up with the squad when everyone has guns out isn't always viable. 

2.  LMG is a great support weapon. I'm not running out being the tip of the spear for my squad. I'm laying down sustained fire to cover my team while they advance regardless of map size. That L110 200x round mag says that no enemy is peaking that alley while my assault or recon mates are moving up. 
If whoever is in front of me goes down, I'm prefiring my gun around the corner and sweeping the WHOLE  room while peaking the corner until I see that kill marker pop up. This got me more kills in close quarters against smg/assault/carbine users than anything else. 

I ran a mix of closed and open games. I prefer closed weapons, yes I'll miss SMG on Support, but I can always run a different class or play around with whichever carbine best works close range, which happened to be the meta in beta. 
 
I think having the LMG speed buff is higher value than the small smg handling buff and the LMG is useful on maps of all sizes in team play. On bigger maps like Liberation Peak I'd switch to a silenced, fast mag, hs multiplier on the KTS100. Small maps was 200 mag L110. 

Don't even get me started on if you catch a squad unaware and you can just mow them all down... This beta actually made me enjoy using an LMG finally after all the years of being a smg/dmr main, switching between the two based on the map, and it felt good. My only complaint in LMG vs SMG is that I felt like SMGs  were too good at a distance in BF6 which was my second most played weapon class (I tried them all out) and LMGs do need a more impactful suppression effect.

Battlefield has its own satisfying traditional gun sway animation in every battlefield but now it looks like cod a lot. Downvote me all you want but its true the animations look like call of duty. And battlefield should not copy that. Let each others games have there own sprinting gun sway animations and not copy each other. And battlefield wants to LOOK like cod. And Dont get wrong i like Vince zampla but he should stay in making story modes and campaigns and NOT be involved in the multiplayer cuz remember he was a excod guy that made cod games like Mw2 and cod 2 and cod3.

1mwx4gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcerNitro/comments/1mwx4gm/undervolting_cpu/,,4,Undervolting CPU,SumDudeThatExists,False,True,False,,False,"I'm aware that there are other posts asking this exact question that have been made in the past. I am only making this post to see if there have been any updates, or workarounds that have been discovered recently due to these CPU's being locked out from undervolting. 

I own an Acer Nitro 5 laptop with an i7-12650H/4060. My clockspeed/voltages are either full balls to the wall to the point of thermal throttling and destroying performance or not, no in between. I have messed with throttlestop some but I'm not having too much luck with it.

Keep in mind, I've had this laptop for a year, this has been the case since the day I bought it, I even have a laptop cooling pad, I have yet to change the thermal paste though < Might be my problem?

I often disable the intel ""Turbo Boost"" through throttlestop. Which is fine as I'm still able to get optimal performance in a majority of modern titles. Sadly with some more recent games this isn't the case. 

My CPU gets around 70c with it running at around 25-30 watts at 2.3ghz with turbo boost disabled on the default fan settings in NitroSense, the fans are only slightly audible. 

I really, really, really, just wish I could have more control over my voltages/frequencys, as Nitro sense on its own just simply is not enough. 

This became very apparent in the recent BF6 beta.  Seeing my laptop perform like a 1660TI desktop PC is pretty disheartening. 

  
Sorry for the rant - TL:DR - Any recent workarounds for undervolting or changing the frequency's of  an i7 12650h.

1mwwxgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwwxgx/2_questions_about_bf6/,,1,2 questions about BF6,broplsineedhelp,False,True,False,,False,"1. What is the go with naval warfare? Doesn’t seem like it will be in any of the maps, doesn’t seem like swimming is even a mechanic of the game. Is there any updates on whether it’ll come to the game perhaps in a future update? I’d sell my kidneys for a paracel storm remake, and even an entire naval warfare season post launch that brings back carrier assault. I know this game will focus heavily on Europe and America rather than the pacific like BF4. But come on a naval warfare update with maps in the Bahamas, Florida Keys or hell even Ibiza would be awesome. 

2. How does customisation work? We obviously know we are getting soldier skins but is it going to be like 2042 and other cod games? Or is it going to be like BFV with its outfit packs and the ability to mix and match packs? I’ve always thought BFV had the perfect customisation mechanic it was just hindered by stupid skins that betrayed the ww2 aesthetic, it wasn’t very immersive being revived by the phantom of the opera. On the other hand when DICE dropped the more historically accurate skins for all the factions it was awesome and being able to mix and match packs was even cooler. Would love to see this feature return as it offered so much more player choice than operator skins we got in 2042. Also skins will be locked to either faction right? Surely?
