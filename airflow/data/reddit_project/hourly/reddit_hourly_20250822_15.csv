Hoping i could get some help from the people at bapccanada! Friend and I mostly play the same stuff and we work at the same company so this advice will help 2 people :)

  
Looking to build a PC in the upcoming weeks for gaming but also for work. Games we'll play range from the upcoming BF6 to League of Legends, to indie games for fun. Looking for 1440p gaming. Personally have 3 monitors (1 UW 34'', 2x 27'', all 1440p) and friend has 2 monitors (UW 34'' and 1x 27'', both 1440p).

For work, we mainly use the M365 suite, bunch of adobe PDF, browser tabs and excel files open. Outlook and teams for voice / video call is a must. I personally like to fool around with fusion 360 and my 3d printer, VMs and whatnot, but those are very occasional so not critical.

Budget would be 2750 to 3000 for a mid-tower from scratch. We both work for a VAR so we have access to a lot of parts for cost instead of retail pricing. Some stuff is still better at a retail store since company is more enterprise focused so stuff like GPUs can be cheaper (i.e. the 5070ti in the config below can be had for 1031$, and an asus prime 5080 would be 1348) but other more consumer parts are usually more expensive (case, PSU, mobo...).

I like to still be able to upgrade in the future (storage, possibly upgrading the GPU in a couple years or so).

 

With context established, here's my questions:

* We've pretty much decided that AMD and a 5070ti would be a sweet spot but we're still checking if a 5080 could fit in the budget - I've put together this config so far - [https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/9Pqrb2)

* we're very much undecided between 9800x3d, 9900x or 9700x. so far, the below is my understanding so please correct me if i am wrong (All MSRP price):

*  

   * 9800x3d - \~689$, gaming king but I also work from my desktop and those CPU are kinda meh for multitasking... Not sure how BAD they would be for my use case though...

   * 9900x - \~649$ 12 cores, 24 threads, great for multitasking, sometimes worst than a 9700x for gaming because of 2 CCDs and core parking being spotty with AMD...

   * 9700x - \~520$ - better performance in some games than the 9900x, ok multitasking but is essentially an 9800X3D without the cache.

* On one hand, I want to go 9800x3d but can't find any clear picture on how much worst it would be at work related stuff. I can't imagine it would be THAT bad but all I read is ""it sucks for work tasks"" but no clear comparison. The 9900x seems like a good deal with the sales going on right now but... feels like a bad deal compared to the 9700x... The 9700x seems great but then you're so close to just having a juggernaut for gaming for just a bit more with the 9800x3d.

* I've also been looking at the 265k from intel but value prop seems to just not be there... specially in an architecture that will not be supported long term. AM5/ZEN 5 was already confirmed to stay the standard until at least 2027, possibly beyond.

Hey all, I am buying a 5070Ti for my PC. I like playing AAA games and FPS games at 1440p. I’m currently torn on whether or not I should upgrade to AM5 or keep what I have on AM4. I know that I’ll need to probably upgrade the processor and of course PSU (850w?). What do you all suggest? I have a mini itx so having to shell out a lot of extra money on a full upgrade for AM5 isn’t really appealing but I also don’t want to totally limit my 5070Ti. Just didn’t like the frames I was getting with my 3060Ti in COD and BF6. Thanks in advance!

Now I can play 2042 at all without a massive amount of stuttering.

I am running a 9800X3D, RTX 5090, 32GB Ram so there should be no issues with my PC.  I even ran a maxxed out burn in on OCCT to make sure I wasn't having any hardware issues. All other games are playing fine but 2042 even with everything set to low stutters very badly.  I can even stand still at spawn and spind a 360 with massive stuttering.

 I have dropped setting to low, turned off anything I can turn off but still it persists.

I am at a loss as to what I can try next at this point.
