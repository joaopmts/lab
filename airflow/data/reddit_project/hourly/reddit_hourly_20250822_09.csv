I recently just built a new computer since my old one was starting to show its age (couldn’t run BF6 at max settings 1440p without frames dipping below 60) and recently listed it up locally on Facebook and OfferUp and was wondering if $1000 is a reasonable price or not.

i7 9700k
MSI Z390 Gaming Plus
Corsair Vengeance 32GB
ASUS TUF RTX 3080
Samsung 970 Evo 2TB
Corsair Rm750x PSU
Corsair H100i Cooler
Lian Li case and Noctua fans

It seems like the parts separately (used) would end up being around the price I listed it at but I’m also aware that this hardware is now considered old, so is it too high?

Dear Community, after waiting a few days on a reply, today I got advised by the EA Support after reaching out to try and post here/discord/twitter and see if there is support.

Following issue: During the last few hours of the BF6 Open Beta I still grinded to get the Repairing Challenge aswell as the Reach Rank 15 complete - which I manged to do, but during my last few missions the progress bar was stuck and not moving further... For the repairing I played multiple rounds engineer, running after tanks/apc's and repairing only, the bar not moving up further... Same when reaching Rank 15, the bar did not change... The challanges were not yet expired and seemed to be active, but no progress was logged...

Is there still a way to get those rewards? Really would've loved to have those available playing on launch.

Thanks in advance for any support.

Reddit is living in a bubble for real.

People who react about movements are always the people who complain. The people who are satisfied say nothing. And that's very often the majority.

I'm playing since BF1942 and I didn't find BF6 movements to be overdone in any way.

The problem is that there were bugs that allowed players to abuse the movements. But the raw movements were not op. Bugs MUST be fixed, but you can't balance a game based on bugs. First you fix the bugs, then you test, and then you adjust the game.

You're talking about ""classic Bttlefield movements experience"" and saying BF6 movements are ""op"" while BF4 has jumpicking (and Reddit wants BF6 to be like BF4) and BF2 has dolphin diving. A classic BF experience means absolutely nothing. Movements were different in each BF games.

I see a lot of people wanting a slow game or even a ""milsim"". Just look at the number of Portal servers on 2042 ""200% damage milsim"". Battlefield is not and never will be a milsim game. It's an arcade game. Less arcade than COD, but still an arcade game. I you want a slow game, you can buy Hell Let Loose or Squad.

And when I see the number of people who say every time this thing or that thing looks like COD, I can assure you that they've never played a COD to say that because BF6 was far from being COD in the beta.",False,/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mx1nep/reddit_is_living_in_a_bubble/,Battlefield6,1755854268.0,4,0.36,Discussion

My current build was top of the line when I built it 7-8 years ago i9-9990k, 2080ti, 32gb ddr4. Since then, I haven't followed PC parts much at all. I know AMD is the CPU king now, but I don't even know when they surpassed Intel lol.

My PC has served me well, but playing at 1440p on current gen games I'm starting to feel its age. I'm OK playing at low/medium graphics, but after the BF6 beta it got me wanting to go to my next build. Getting only 60~ fps at everything lowest setting felt pretty bad.

Was wondering if next CPU generation cycle is projected to have significant performance leaps for gaming. I realize it's probably just rumors at this point, but I'd be willing to wait 1-1.5 years if there are spicy rumors of next gen looking real good etc.
