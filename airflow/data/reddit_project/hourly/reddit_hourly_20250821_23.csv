The one thing I’ve struggled with is servers generally being very one-sided. I’m by no means an amazing player, but I’m also not terrible, and I’ve constantly run into an issue where one team starts winning, while the other starts losing and people leave; the server doesn’t really readjust or balance out in between games, so it kinda feels like getting stuck in a loss-loop.

Does anyone on NA have any tips for avoiding this? I don’t expect to win every match, but I also don’t feel like it’s normal to be losing every match. I want to be able to play the game, not just keep getting server stacked into a corner.

It’s especially a problem when maps like Somme come up, which are unbalanced to begin with and some people leave when they’re on weak side.

Long time lurker, and finally a first time poster. Got my first rig about a year ago. Before you crucify me, I didn't know about the subreddit and kinda bought blindly after doing *some* research and what seemed like a good deal at the time. Got an MSI Aegis R9 (yeah, now I know...). 

It's got: 

MSI PRO B760 WiFi 7
i9 14900f 
MSI Ventus 2X OC 4070 
32GB Ram 

Ventilation is decent, not superb, with the GPU staying around 55-60c with both GPU fans and case fans blowing like an F35. To be fair I have not looked at CPU temps (away from home for a few days so can't really check either). 

Been looking into upgrading into a 5080, solely because the 4070 seems to be lagging behind, and it's not anywhere near max game settings. I'm usually on COD, will be on BF6 (the beta didn't really play great on my rig), Cities Skyline II, Fallout, Chornobyl, RDR2 etc. I try to dip into a bit of everything where and when I can. Also been trying to play Alan Wake 2, as I played the first one on console many years ago and have heard awesome things about it. 

Besides from a 5080, looking to upgrade:

-PSU as my PC came with a non modular 750w unit. Been looking at Corsair RMe RM1000e 80+ gold 
-Add Corsair iCue Link TITAN 240RX AIO, currently just air cooled 
-MSI RTX5080 16G GAMING TRIO OC to replace my 4070 

Now, my question to the PCMR is: is this worth my time upgrading these components, knowing the 14900f is not the ideal CPU for gaming? Would these components make a difference on my gaming experience? I might not be able to max out settings, I totally get that, but I'm hoping it delivers better and more consistent gameplay than the frame drops or the ghosting from frame gen (when on) on the 4070. 

You can totally tell me I'm delusional, and this crap will never behave the way I'm wanting it to. Just looking for smooth, 1440p gaming with low input lag and decent frame rates at a good visual setting. 

Bonus question: would an eBay sourced 4090 be a good choice? Non FE versions seem to range from $1600-$3400. I'm a little skittish buying something that expensive knowing I might get something totally different. 

Lastly, please feel free to chime in and recommend any further upgrades or different parts from what I've described above. 

Really appreciate y'all. Hoping to make this happen.

Medics running around with sniper rifles, engineers rocking LMGs… it kills the whole identity of the classes.

Part of what made the older Battlefields feel so good was that weapon choice was tied to class. You instantly knew what role someone was playing, and it forced teamwork, recons handled long range, medics supported with their kit, engineers dealt with vehicles, and assaults pushed the line.

In BF6’s beta, it feels like class choice doesn’t matter because you can just equip whatever gun you want. To me, that takes away from both immersion and balance.

On top of that, I’d love sniper glint to only mean “recon with a scope aimed at you.” Not a medic with a health bag camping a hill and a sniper rifle.

What do you guys think? would closed weapons make BF6 stronger and bring back that classic Battlefield feel, or do you prefer the open weapons?

So, for example, if you don't like the inherent randomness of matchmaking, you could create a custom Portal server (that is persistent) and pick the map rotation you want, maybe increase the ticket count, disallow some weapons/gadgets if you'd like, etc. and call your server something memorable like ""Reggie's Awesome Server!!!"" (or ""! Turtles"" or ""! Flubber"" or ""! STONKS"" à la some of the popular BF4 servers). If enough people like that configuration, more and more people will join it and you'd have that classic Battlefield community that way.

Maybe if you are a part of a community on Discord or something you can have links/codes to your Portal servers so everyone in your community plays on the same server(s). That's not to mention the mountains of improvements and additional customization they added to BF6's Portal compared to 2042.

This way, they get to keep matchmaking for the majority of players who don't care about the ""community"" aspect of a persistent server and just want to play the fucking game. Plus you can still select a gamemode and/or map using custom search, which I expect to be improved even more before launch.

It also means that you don't have this ridiculous, endless list of ""[DICE] Conquest US East #21144"" that you have to wade through to find a map/gamemode you want to play. I remember that being a really, really annoying thing about past Battlefield games.

Another thing I'm confused about is the whole ""official"" server thing. The devs have said that they'd have ""verified"" servers that, if a server is customized within reason (i.e. true to a normal Battlefield experience), you can receive full XP as if it were an ""official"" server. Isn't that the same effect as actual official servers?

Also, with respect to the criticism of, ""well, Portal is a hidden feature and not the main menu so nobody will use it,"" then maybe they can advertise popular Portal servers on the home page in addition to the normal matchmaking servers? It could be a section like, ""Your friends [on EA Connect] frequently play these Portal servers"" or something similar. Remember to fill out the Open Beta survey with your suggestions because I know I will!

I know this subreddit can get... heated, but I genuinely want to know why this isn't literally a perfect solution. Is it just a lack of trust that they will deliver?

P.S. I've played this franchise since about 2012 starting with BF3 so I am a true ""BaTtLeFieLd vEtERaN"" or whatever.
