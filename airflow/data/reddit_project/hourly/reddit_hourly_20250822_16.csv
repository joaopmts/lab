Battlefield 6 beta went out, big fan of bf saga and i couldn't spectate that, so i still played the beta horribly honestly and now im about to cope this pc.  
  
the new specs: intel Core i7-14700 - B760M-A AX6 II - 16GB DDR5 5600Mhz Kingston Fury Beast XMP - 1TB M.2 Kingston SNV3S/1000G NVMe PCIe Gen 4.0 - Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB GDDR6, Asus Prime (i have doubts with this GPU.) - 650W 80 Plus Silver, Gigabyte ICE - Cooler Master ML240 Illusion ARGB

That pc with a Antec CX600M Trio White, 3xFan.. it's pretty and also like 1800usd. (im from chile so that would be likely the conversion.)

What could you say about those specs? it would be good? for how many years? BF6 would be playable atleast in mid?   
Im not a hardcore player, i use the pc just for discord and games with friends, maybe forza horizon 5... with this new pc i would love to play stalker 2 because my actual one didn't run well..

I’m not sure if it’s a skill issue or if they just feel underpowered. For example, the IFV’s cannon feels like it has no projectile velocity and drops instantly, as well as no explosive damage. It does one-shot on direct hits, but I feel as if this shouldn’t be the role of a vehicle. It feels almost like I’m playing recon to me except my bullets drop after 100 ft. The MBT isn’t so bad, the cannon seems to have decent splash (albeit still lack luster to me, but it’s not bad). Vehicle responsiveness and movement controls are ok I suppose. 

Overall the ground vehicle experience to me just screams lackluster, but I see almost no one talking about in the community whether laypeople or high profile community members, and I’m curious if I’m alone on this. 

I’m not making this post here to make a claim about whether they need to be buffed or nerfed, more-so gather community sentiment about how ground vehicles play since I’m seeing no one else talk about it.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mxbr58/thoughts_on_bf6_ground_vehicles/,Battlefield,1755881360.0,6,1.0,Battlefield 6

Short summery:

I enabled secureboot and pc was booting fine, I then cleaned it with a hairdryer (as I have done many times without problems whatsoever) and then it wasn't booting at all. No post screen, no beeps- nothing!

At that point I really thought I fried my motherboard because of the hairdryer. But reading some posts about secureboot fucking up Gigabyte boards has lead me to think that perhaps this was the problem.

Specs:

CPU: Ryzen 7 5700X

MB: Gigabyte B450M DS3H

RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3200MHZ 8GBx4

GPU: Gigabyte RTX 2060

PSU: Antec 650W

What I've tried:

Resetting CMOS

Different GPU, CPU

Removing and reseating RAM (Even without any RAM sticks it wasn't even giving me any beeps)

At that point I was ready to throw the towel and get another motherboard, but I read that some users have tried booting with CPU internal graphics with some success. Since I didn't have an am4 CPU with integrated graphics I decided that getting a cheap Athlon 200GE would be worth the shot since it was cheaper than a new MB. Placed an order for 20$ and waited a while.

Today I got it from the mail and threw it in my MB- AND IT FUCKING WORKS! So baffling. I really thought this MB was toast. I was getting nothing! No beeps, no screen output.

Next thing was to reflash the bios through uefi (my motherboard doesn't have a qflash button, and I wasn't even getting it to post) and than switching to my 5700X and booting and everything works as before.

My guess is that enabling secureboot somehow overrides the GPU. No idea

I'm writing this because this is such an obscure problem that have come up with the recent BF6 beta needing the have secureboot enabled, and I hope this is helpful to anyone having this problem as well.

Now that the bf6 beta is gone I am playing this again until that releases.

I remember having the ability to zero a sniper scope with a button, like setting it to 300 meters so you don't need to have a specific scope with a line down to show you where the bullet goes and then taking trying to aim with the bottom half of the scope picture and can instead just aim with the center.

Can you even do that in this game?",False,/r/battlefield2042/comments/1mxauga/can_you_zero_your_scope_in_this_game/,battlefield2042,1755879312.0,9,0.67,Question
