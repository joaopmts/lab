I haven‚Äôt had many issues with the controller on any other game (aside from some random moments it would continue to fire on Call of Duty until I pressed the trigger again, but that hasn‚Äôt happened in a while). 

So with Battlefield 2042 and 6 I‚Äôm having problems where it either won‚Äôt fire randomly, will fire in bursts, or I will continue to lay down shots and it will just randomly stop. I can get 5-6 kills normally then the next couple will just have random firing issues. It‚Äôs only an issue with these games and this controller. I‚Äôve tried both the Xbox Elite V2 and PS4 with no issues. It only happens with these 2 games. The other Battlefields work no problem, same with CoD and other shooters. 

The controller is up to date, all buttons/triggers/sticks show that they function as they should. I‚Äôve messed with deadzones and the trigger locks and that didn‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm really at a loss as I‚Äôd prefer to use this controller and not have to switch to other controllers just for 2 games. 

Has anyone had these issues and/or any idea on what else I might be able to do before sending this controller in for warranty? It‚Äôs only a few months old and has been babied. ",False,/r/8bitdo/comments/1mwzi5v/issues_with_8bitdo_ultimate_2_on_bf2042_and_bf6/,8bitdo,1755845932.0,4,1.0,Question

So I wanted to post here and see what sort of a discussion we could create in relation to the BF6 beta and what we all think it needs and doesn't need. Personally I've played every BF game since Bad Company 1 with the exception of Hardline and 2042. Because of this I felt compelled to give my opinion based on what I saw in the beta because Battlefield really is one of my favorite franchises in gaming. Please feel free to comment and discuss what changes you liked and disliked and let's try and spark a great discussion that could result in some positive change. 

I want to start by saying that all in all I actually had a good bit of fun on the beta, and although I have a few things that I believe could be done better I think DICE have a really good base for what could be a really great battlefield game. 

Below are some game mechanics I believe could be refined and changed slightly to produce something truly special. 

Movement speed: I think it would be really easy to change the pace of the game by slowing down movement speed just a tad. Perhaps a mechanic where long periods of running give you a touch of tunnel vision or slight vignette. I think a BF game lends itself to a more tactical style of movement as opposed to jumping round corners and seeing who can get a shot off first. I'd personally welcome a more milsim(ish) style of game play. 

Surpression: I loved the no passive healing  whilst being suppressed mechanic, but there wasn't much physical change to the screen when under fire. I think if being suppressed  had more of an effect on the players screen perhaps we might get more people using it as a tactic as opposed to trying to secure long range kills as a primary defense. 

Awareness assist: So I personally thought something was off with the spotting but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Frequently I could see enemy markers through smoke or walls which just essentially gives the players hacks. I believe if this system were taken away entirely and replaced with a more elaborate ping system that can only be shared primarily amongst squads and then also through squad leaders we might get further reason to use suppression as a tactic. 

Hit markers: I get why a lot of people like hit markers. I just think maybe we could change them? Replace HUD style hit markers for blood spray and you instantly have something that aids the player in feeling immersed in the combat. On top of that I think taking away hit markers means smoke is even more effective because you won't know if you've hit something or not whilst firing through it. This will encourage the further use of suppression. 

To summarise, I think BF6 has the potential to be a really exceptional shooter. With the changes I'm suggesting here I really think this will be one for the fans. Currently though the game feels a bit flat. I think things like HUD based hit markers, fast movement speed and  awareness assist through marked enemies makes the game feel like it's been made to draw another fan based in and not one made for the battlefield fan. Personally I believe that these suggestions might make the game feel more like a team game and drive players to play the objective rather than run around trying to get as many kills as possible. 

Please let me know what you think about these ideas! I'm excited to see what the community feeling is and let's see what new ideas we can come up with.

DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) are no joke. If you are sitting still for multiple hours, you aren't using your leg muscles (especially calve muscles). Your blood can't return back to the heart by itself as it has lost most of its speed by the time it gets to returning to the heart, so your calve muscles squeeze to help move the blood back to the heart. If you aren't using your calve muscles (i.e. you've been sitting for too long - commonly due to a long flight, a long surgery or an average Battlefield gaming session) then you are at risk of your blood remaining still (stagnant). Sometimes, this blood can clot. This is very dangerous as the clot can dislodge and get stuck in your heart or lungs, leading to serious problems like pulmonary embolism or cardiomyopathy which can cause arrhythmias and death. You can't PTFO if you're dead. Think of this as tactically redeploying so you're out of the action of the game for a short duration but then you're back with full ammo and max grenades.

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

PC build with old 500W PSU and drives from old build.

CPU is extremely hot compared to my earlier Ryzen 5 3600, never saw it below 70 degrees.
Can set the fans to max, temps dont change.

Didnt boot the first time when both sticks where inserted.

PC randomly just shuts off, non-replicable but not under load.

BF6 Beta played without problems, Helldivers 2 sets gpu fans on max (but I thinks its a rather unoptimized game).

As of now it always happend while watching yt videos in Edge, some times 5 minutes after a cold start, some times after hours of gaming and then switching over to watching videos.


**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Thought of PSU being underpowered so I changed the 500W PSU, issue still happening.

Cleaned former nvidia drivers, still happening.

Redone thermal paste twice (initially with the cooler provided paste in a thicker layer, 
then the old school pea sized drop, then two thin lines spaced apart but that dropped temps in idle from 80 to 75), no change, temps still high.

Going to change the CPU for a newer Ryzen 5 running not that hot, cant rule out that the board
interprets the always high temps (average 86 degrees on CPU, 95 on package according to 
HWMonitor) as reason to shut of when load goes away.

There was a dev comment screenshot posted here saying they are 'looking into' the autospotting, but that's equally concerning because most people agree it simply needs to be removed and recon should get an alternative passive. It doesn't need to be adjusted, it needs to be deleted.

The bigger problem is a lack of server browser and persistent lobbies. I won't go into when this is such a big issue as it's been discussed to death but it's huge, especially for players like me in lower pop regions. We will probably have a server browser in Portal but it may not have persistent lobbies and Portal itself may be hidden in the atrocious Netflix UI. Also no mention of changes to the UI, which is universally hated. 

The changes addressed in the debrief are good, but we should be worried about the omission of these two major pain points for the community.

I have sone maybe 15 matches in hazard zone now and this one seems it will take forever. Do people not play for the objectives or extractions?

1mwyzdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,,0,Battlefield has always been fast-paced,Repeat34,False,True,False,,False,"Battlefield has been ‚ÄúCOD-like‚Äù ever since BF3. As someone who‚Äôs sunk thousands of hours into every Battlefield since then‚Äîalong with plenty of time in Arma, Squad, Hell Let Loose, and Tarkov‚ÄîI honestly don‚Äôt understand why players keep complaining about fast-paced movement (within reason, of course‚Äînot teleporting like BF4 or exploiting ledge glitches in the beta).

**Here‚Äôs the core issue:** Battlefield maps and gameplay were never designed around slow, tactical movement. The reason Arma, Squad, and Tarkov *do* work with slower pacing is because nearly every design decision in those games supports realism‚Äîor at least the perception of it. Things like stamina bars, stricter health systems, massive spread-out maps, and limited spawn mechanics are all built to force slower, methodical play.

Battlefield is the opposite. It has always thrived on chaos, spectacle, and streamlined mechanics. Huge maps with tons of cover, vehicles flying overhead, instant squad spawns, and dozens of players crashing into objectives all at once. If you try to force slower pacing into that environment, Battlefield stops feeling like Battlefield‚Äîit just becomes a worse version of Arma or Squad (and a headglitch fest at that).

Fast movement has always been part of Battlefield‚Äôs identity, and frankly, it‚Äôs what makes it fun. Even in the BF6 beta, it‚Äôs still the *slowest* Battlefield we‚Äôve had since BF3‚Äîeven with the knife out. A lot of the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù clips people point to are just movement glitches, and even when they aren‚Äôt, that kind of movement usually hurts the player more than it helps.

It really feels like some people want Battlefield to turn into Arma or Squad. And I say this as someone who *loves* those games‚Äîif that‚Äôs what you want, go play them! They scratch that itch perfectly. But Battlefield has always been an arcade shooter at its core, and trying to slow it down or ‚Äúrealism it up‚Äù ruins what makes it unique.

I‚Äôd genuinely like to hear any solid counterarguments or feedback, but for me, Battlefield‚Äôs fast-paced, chaotic movement is a feature, not a flaw. And the last thing I want is for it to become another watered-down version of COD or some pseudo-milsim clone.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,Battlefield,1755843959.0,15,0.4,Battlefield 6
