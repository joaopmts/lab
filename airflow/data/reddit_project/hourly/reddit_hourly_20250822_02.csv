Po meni su se uglavnom vratili na stare staze sto je odlicno, igrao sam dve open bete i ovakav osecaj dok sam igrao battlefield igricu nisam imao od BF4 (koji je izasao 2013. inace). Puske i pucanje su odlicne (tu je po meni za neke puske manja zamerka malo slabiji recoil ali to mogu da poprave do oktobra, mada je to EA pa se nikad ne zna), mape su po meni sasvim zadovoljavajuce mada bi trebali da dodaju nekoliko vecih mapa do izlaska igrice. 
Jedina prava zamerka su kola, motori, tenkovi i tome slicno (jel'te po engleski vehicles) po meni mogu neki put da budu jako teska da se kontrolisu a nekad su kao da vozis kola u gta 5, isto se na nekim mapama spawn-uje previse kola/motora/helikoptera pa onda gameplay bude da izbegnes sve kamikaze koje lete po mapi a ne da se fokusiras na zadatak koji ti je dat te runde. Sve u svemu po meni ovo moze da bude jedna od jacih igrica u BF serijalu (doduse BF1 i BF4 su idalje 1. i 2. mesto po meni i tesko ko ce moci da ih pomeri odakle) jedino ako EA ne zasere nesto kao sto obicno umeju. 

A kod vas kakva je situacija? Da li cete kupiti novi BF? Znam da neki ljudi nisu pipnuli nijedan BF od cetvorke, mozda ima takvih slucaja i kod nas, doduse ja jeste da nisam kupio nijedan BF od BF1 ali mi jeste drug kupio BF5 koji je po meni u kranju ruku okej.

1mwuwff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwuwff/as_a_dominationkoth_exclusive_enjoyer_bf6_is/,,1,"As a Domination/KOTH Exclusive Enjoyer, BF6 Is ALMOST Perfect",GarageDoorOpener2,False,True,False,,False,"As someone who doesn't usually play Battlefield, playing BF6's Call of Duty-esque game modes was extremely enjoyable for me. For the first time in a long time, I got my casual balls to the walls brainrot fix from Domination and KOTH, something that I didn't think was going to happen. Obviously, I know the wider Battlefield community will not be playing it all that much, but I got a lot of BO2 and XDefiant vibes from these game modes and it made me sit down for nearly ten hours straight on the first day of global beta access. 

It also helped that it still had some Battlefield flavor with revives, support, and a stronger emphasis on objective play. I really liked how I could slay out and cap flags or push hills at the same time, while pulling my squadmates away from gunfire so my team would have more help putting pressure on the enemies. It was always very satisfying to see myself on the top of the scoreboard of my team almost every single time because the way these modes are set up makes it very easy to do both simultaneously. It's real good fun.

There are a couple of issues with these game modes, though, and I think they're actually pretty simple to implement.

The first thing I would change is to actually make the respawn timer longer. In contrast to Conquest, these game modes have it where you can respawn immediately after being downed, and then the game decides where you spawn as opposed to picking your spawn yourself.

Now, I really like games where I can die and immediately get back in with very little downtime, which, if I'm being honest, is why Battlefield never really caught my interest in the past. But, I would argue that the timer to respawn is too quick. Because the objective is more pronounced in Battlefield as opposed to other games, having as many people around the objective is a good strat if you're trying to get time on the hill during KOTH for example.

So what ends up happening is that in most lobbies, people tend to forego reviving or dropping medpacks because its assumed that you'll just spawn right back in. But this is counter intuitive because the game usually spawns you pretty far away from the objective after dying, which means that it's extremely hard to actually make a comeback, unless your team can get the jump on the next point, or the next rotation on Domination. And if a medic or squadmate is nearby, players decide to bleed out when they were just about to revived, which has happened both to me and happened to many medics that I've given up on because I was convinced no one would revive me.

So if the timer is just a little slower, then this problem may be fixed.

Another issue is that at least with a couple maps, some of the objective spots were a little poorly thought out. The best example I can give is on Empire State KOTH, where the D hill is at that Gazebo spot. On that hill, almost no one can get time on it because the bounds of that hill are so wide that both teams are always constantly on it, and if one team does happen to take control, the other team virtually can't make any play to take control themselves because of the layout of the hill. Some objectives just need some adjusting, and while I can't give specific feedback on how to fix them, at the very least I can make it known that it's a bit of a frustrating issue.

Other than that, I don't really think I have much to say other than what everyone else is saying. Nerf movement a little bit, nerf shotgun, wipe with some elbow grease, and we should be good to go. I had a lot of fun with these game modes and I'm excited to potentially main BF6 for a good while.

Before playing this game, I've only seen it on steam or just the cover for it, and then I watch a video made by Tbag Gaming which showed gameplay that caught my interest. The gameplay looked pretty similar to battlefield and the beta for bf6 just ended recently so I thought I'd try out the game on PS5

It's day 2 of playing the game, so I tried out the operations mode and my first real warfare match after doing a practice with AI. And I just feel so confused overall. I see that there's a campaign story but I don't see where to play it? Is it through the operations? The Black Hawk Down mission? Or something else I'm not seeing? I watch these cutscenes with these characters and the villain being broken out of a prison, but nothing about a campaign story about them to play, at least not that I can see on the game.

The controls are a mess in my opinion, mainly the keybinds for gadgets, I have a lot of moments where I'm trying to use one thing and keep pulling out another. The menu navigation feels annoying, because I can't seem to back out completely and view every mode or option there is, but I'm instead forced to switch between them. The controls sometimes actually bug out and you can't do stuff on random menus including when trying to deploy in a match, or the cursor will just completely disable itself at random times.

Not sure how I feel about operators but they're okay I guess, at least this game seems to be made for them unlike 2042. Is this supposed to be mainly multiplayer where the story and context is just in cutscenes or something?

I really hope the game improves on console over time, because I don't want to drop it already. If anyone has any starting advice, I'd appreciate it.",False,/r/DeltaForceGlobal/comments/1mwuvfw/this_game_has_me_confused/,DeltaForceGlobal,1755830503.0,6,0.67,Discussion 🗣️
