BF2042 isn't terrible when I started playing it as it is, rather than thinking about what it isn't.

The Iwo Jima map is insanely good. I have never been a huge vehicle user, so the idea of a map with little building coverage never really interested me, but the immersion that vehicles bring is amazing. I started tank hunting and man is that satisfying when you C4 one, or get the last hit with a rocket launcher. Helicopters flying overhead, crashing, the jets swooping low, the whole thing is very good.

With that being said: The BF6 Beta

I really enjoyed the beta, I love the close quarters combat that we got from it, Cairo was my favorite map and the only one that really had like a ""modern"" taste to it. I've played Squad and there's something cool about running around Fallujah-ish type maps. 

I'm ok with smaller maps - but I now do think it needs more vehicles and to be a bit larger + bigger lobbies.

Visually speaking - as a ground soldier, witnessing helicopters flying overhead, crashing into those tall buildings, the destruction. Running out from a small alley with a tank or two patrolling the streets puts you in situations you don't otherwise get in any other game. **This is what it was missing.**

I think stat-worrying has put a stumbling block in the minds of gamers. People who want a good KD and not die constantly to someone who is very efficient in flying a helicopter, or a tank around every corner, are missing out on the situational challenge that BF games produces. Games are supposed to be FUN. I know that term is different for everyone, but to me the more insane challenges I come across the better.

If I need to get to Objective A and there are two tanks patrolling the streets and I somehow need to get past them, that brings an aspect of situational strategy that is fun. If I die, ok? I'll respawn and try again. I'll do something different, maybe now instead of trying to get by I'll try to blow them up.

On another note - I think class system needs to be locked 100%. I don't think I need to elaborate more on that.

Idk just my thoughts. I want immersion, action movie scenarios, and to just have fun",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx72ni/a_battlefield_vet_take_on_bf2042_and_bf6/,Battlefield,1755870622.0,1,0.31,Battlefield 6

I'm on the path of building my 3rd custom pc build. I'd like the community advice on my component choices.

I'm aiming for a premium build mostly intended for gaming at 1440p 165hz on modern titles (bf6,gta6). I'd like this build to last at least 5 to 7 years. 

AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D;
Asus ROG Strix B650E-E;
Corsair vengeance RGB 2x32GB 6000MHz DDR5;
Asus TUF RTX 5080 Gaming OC;
Corsaire ICUE Link TITAN 360 RX RGB;
Samsung 990 Pro M.2 2TB;
Corsair RM1000x Shift 80 plus Gold;

I haven't choose a case yet. I'm esitating between Corsair ICUE 5000X/D RGB or a Frame 5000D RS RGB

I might also wait for the 5080 Super to come out.

What do you think ?

Did you ever feel like you couldn't break cover or try to flank because the second you did you'd appear as a bright red diamond on the screens of 20 enemy players saying ""Hey! Shoot me!""? Did all this leave you feeling tense, fatigued and unsatisfied with the game? Despite it being an overall great experience there was just something... off. I think I may have part of the reason why. And if you'll stick with me, also a potential solution.

# 2) The Problem

I'm of the opinion that the ubiquity and ease of the team spotting and auto-spotting mechanics detract from the potentially rich, immertive and engrossing design of not just BF6 but almost all modern BF games. I'd go further and say that the games need \*waaaaaay\* less intrusive HUD in general but that's a whole extra convo.

In addition to this, for years (decades) now we've all been aware of how the Recon/Scout class seems like the odd one out. It doesn't really fit neatly into the integrated teamwork jigsaw that Dice aims to create. They don't really have anything unique to contribute to the team effort.

In BF6: Assaults are front-line powerhouses, far more capable of breaking enemy lines than the other classes; Engineers are extremely capable at keeping friendly vehicles in the fight and are by far the best class for taking down heavily armoured enemy vehicles when dismounted; Only Supports are capable of healing and resupplying entire choke points and supporting infantry breakthroughs with rapid revives. Recons..? Well they can auto-spot but that's only marginally better than spamming Q, which everyone can do. The respawn beacon is useful but again it's just a slight extension of squad or vehicle respawning. Long range kills are great but it's probably easier and more efficient to pick assault and get up close and personal if you just want to get kills. The only thing they're reliably useful for is countering other Recons.

# 3) Recon Resentment

This design leads directly to the widespread feeling among players that Recons don't really contribute to the team effort and are just out for their own selfish aggrandisement getting 500 metre snipes from across the map sitting just in front of their own spawn beacon that's literally miles from any objective.

# 4) The Solution

Hence I propose that \*ONLY\* the Recon class should be able to Spot and that they should be given a big points incentive to do so, say 25 or even 50 points per spot and another 100 if that spot leads to a kill by a team mate with the usual +25% bonus for a squad assist (or something like that). This would shift the points incentive for Recons away from long distance kills and to.. you know... ACTUAL RECONNAISSANCE!

Just like in real life: Intelligence, Survailance and Reconnaissance are absolutely vital components of winning firefights, battles, operations and wars. A lack of good intelligence can stop whole offensives in their tracks. Or if they do go ahead, poor intel can lead to unmitigated disaster. Because of this front line reconnaissance units are often extremely highly respected among the ranks. The contribution they make to the team effort is invaluable and essential to the success rest of the force.

Back to Battlefield. A good Recon, unseen and off to the side, overseeing an objective, chokepoint or key area, pointing out unseen enemies, approaching vehicles and well laid traps \*as well as\* taking out well concealed and protected enemies should be able to make the difference between a successful push and a failed meatgrinder.

AND they should be rewarded for doing this! I played whole games in the beta being an absolutely manic Recon, using all the tools, gadgets and abilities to their absolute maximum as they were intended, supporting my team and squad as best i could. Hundreds of spots, dozens of beacon spawns in key areas, sensors picking up enemies behind key choke points, taking out enemies and vehicles with C4 as well counter sniping and picking off unsuspecting enemies. What did I get for all this? Bottom third of the leaderboard with just under 4,000 points.

# 5) Mitigating Side Effects

Now, there is the problem of enemy players being difficult to spot among the chaos and rubble especially with everyone being kitted out in modern, and very effective, camo which I think is why Dice have added the self-only auto-spot whenever you aim near enemies. This, in my opinion, is a bandaid solution and one that should only be temporary. There are many ways to solve this problem. I'm not a professional UI designer or Art Director but a solution could be as follows. A subtle, non-immersion breaking version of  the coloured ""outline"", ""glow"" or ""film"" you see around enemy players in other FOS games like Halo Infinate. I'm not suggesting that Dice make every enemy glow bright red but what I am suggesting is that they use something like this to make enemy silhouettes more distinct from the background colour pallette. And thus slightly more visible to players on the enemy team. Got a desert map where the character models are wearing tan or multicam? Add a subtle semi-transparent mid-brown and/or olive green overlay to the player's character model when seen by enemies. Got a dense forrest map? Add a light-green or tan overlay to the enemy character models. This would make enemies slightly easier to see while maintaining immersion and still making the players pay attention to and interact with with actual environment rather than just looking for red dots. Then when a Recon does spot an enemy and add that red dot above their heads: it's a godsend, and you're greatful to the Recon on your team/squad who helped you out. In addition to the previous points, this could be augmented to act as an extra bonus for Recon players with their stand-out colour overlay being less prominent than. non-Recon players. Like instead of the overlay being at 50% opacity for other players it's only 30% for the Recon class, adding to the stealthy mystique which their real-life counterparts gain.

# 6) Bringing It All Together

In conclusion: I think this change would complete the teamwork jigsaw that Dice is trying to create with the class system. Perhaps controversially, I really like what they've done with the Assault, Engineer and Support classes. Each class has a distinct, important and unique part of the puzzle but no one class can achieve victory alone. Only when all 4 classes come together and put their pieces of the puzzle together does your team start to fire on all cylinders. And when this happens it feels \*\*GOOD\*\*. For this puzzle to be complete, Recons also need their own Unique and valuable contribution to the team dynamic and I believe restricting spotting to Recon exclusively would not only complete the class system but also solve the tiring and unfulfilling problems of player over-visibility and lack of immersion in the environment, thus improving the game experience massively!

Thanks for listening to my TED talk. I'd love to hear further discussion in the comments.
