Follow these steps to get your rewards!","selftext":"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

So I wanted to add a different perspective to the discussion and I guess IБ─≥m not the only one who actually likes the Battlefield 6 filters.\n\nI donБ─≥t want the game to feel like just another generic realistic FPS shooter. I want it to feel like Battlefield 6.\n\nSame thing with BF3. It might not look realistic in terms of color grading, but it feels like BF3. Every time I come back to it, I get the same feeling I had when I first played it all those years ago.\n\nNowadays, everything has to look as realistic as possible and honestly, I think that sucks the soul out of a lot of games and movies. It all starts to blur together. The BF6 filters give the game style, identity, and atmosphere.

The problem being that in 2042, Irish was the only Support operator that had any decent abilities when playing objectives.\n\nYet, whenever choosing this clown, all I hear blasting through my surround sound during the entire match was \"TAKE SOME Fц≈ц≈ц≈ING AMMO!\" and other idiotic nonsense.\n\nThe fact that hearing all of the operators and their ridiculous little phrases was mandatory really annoyed the hell out of me. Throughout Battlefield, we've had our ups and downs. Ups like Bad Company, and downs like the BF3 beta where the hackers were teleporting everyone to a rooftop to gun them down / hiding in the walls shooting through them. But 2042 operator lines that you can't mute...that to Battlefield was like a Netflix live action of any anime.\n\nTLDR: My long ranting and ravings aside...are there operators in BF6?

I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.\n\n- \"Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone\".\n\nYet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and itБ─≥s so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I donБ─≥t see this changing too much at this point because itБ─≥s a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing canБ─≥t be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs donБ─≥t have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. YouБ─≥d only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}

I would buy a 1440p 144hz monitor at minimum. I was looking at the 4070 or 4070 Super and my processor (5600x) and it appears to get around 80-85fps on Ultra at 1440p. Is this good or mediocre?

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.\n\nI know that there are \"night\" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?\n\nThe only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this. Idk, seems like a cool experience the devs could create, and I haven't really seen this in any other multiplayer game, except maybe Tarkov but that's almost an other genre."}

HereБ─≥s what IБ─≥m hyped about and why:\n\n* **Escalation mode** Б─⌠ this could be a *really* fun new experience. If itБ─≥s dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.\n* **Maps** Б─⌠ the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. IБ─≥m especially hyped for Egypt Б─⌠ exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.\n* **Classes + weapon progression** Б─⌠ finally weБ─≥ll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.\n* **Portal** Б─⌠ if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, thatБ─≥s going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.\n* **Campaign** Б─⌠ IБ─≥m genuinely happy weБ─≥re getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.\n* **Battle Royale** Б─⌠ this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BFБ─≥s scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.\n* **Battle Pass** Б─⌠ not much to say yet, but if itБ─≥s not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, itБ─≥ll work fine.\n* **Ranked mode** Б─⌠ I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.\n\nOverall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they donБ─≥t screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.\n\nI think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing."}

{"id":"1myd1p2","title":"Which has worse maps - BFV or 2042","selftext":"Question above, this is just me rambling what prompted me to ask\n\n\nSo just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.\n\nPlayed the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good \n\n I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify \n\nSo BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other?

Follow these steps to get your rewards!","selftext":"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

I've never gotten to like \"endgame\" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.\n\nI also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays.

I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.\n\n- \"Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone\".\n\nYet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and itБ─≥s so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I donБ─≥t see this changing too much at this point because itБ─≥s a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing canБ─≥t be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs donБ─≥t have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. YouБ─≥d only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}

Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.\n\nI know that there are \"night\" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?\n\nThe only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this.

After spending 6-7 hours today alone in BF4 with DMRs, tried every one of them I had unlocked, and not once did I get the feeling they sucked in any way. They worked perfectly from ranged, to medium engagements to packing an absolute punch in CQB when things got hot.\n\nM14/21/39 EBR has been my favorite DMR in any game that features it, and BF6 was the first game in my entire library where I actually hated it. It was just awful to work with. The other DMR that was in the Beta was alright, at least a two hit kill on body, but it honestly felt like you were firing an Anzio 20mm or a Snipex Alligator.

{"id":"1myehur","title":"Why I think Battlefield 6 has a really strong launch lineup (and why DICE is on the right track)","selftext":"After reading all the info about BF6Б─≥s launch content, I honestly think DICE has a really solid foundation this time. HereБ─≥s what IБ─≥m hyped about and why:\n\n* **Escalation mode** Б─⌠ this could be a *really* fun new experience. If itБ─≥s dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.\n* **Maps** Б─⌠ the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. IБ─≥m especially hyped for Egypt Б─⌠ exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.\n* **Classes + weapon progression** Б─⌠ finally weБ─≥ll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.\n* **Portal** Б─⌠ if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, thatБ─≥s going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.\n* **Campaign** Б─⌠ IБ─≥m genuinely happy weБ─≥re getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.\n* **Battle Royale** Б─⌠ this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BFБ─≥s scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.\n* **Battle Pass** Б─⌠ not much to say yet, but if itБ─≥s not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, itБ─≥ll work fine.\n* **Ranked mode** Б─⌠ I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.\n\nOverall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they donБ─≥t screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.\n\nI think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing."}

{"id":"1myd1p2","title":"Which has worse maps - BFV or 2042","selftext":"Question above, this is just me rambling what prompted me to ask\n\n\nSo just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.\n\nPlayed the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good \n\n I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify \n\nSo BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other?
