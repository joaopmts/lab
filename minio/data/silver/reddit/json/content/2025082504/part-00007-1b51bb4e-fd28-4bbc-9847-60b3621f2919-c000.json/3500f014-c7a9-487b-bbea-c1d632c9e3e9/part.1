And especially with the constant intense CQB in the tight small maps, made the DMRs actually shit to use. After spending 6-7 hours today alone in BF4 with DMRs, tried every one of them I had unlocked, and not once did I get the feeling they sucked in any way. They worked perfectly from ranged, to medium engagements to packing an absolute punch in CQB when things got hot.\n\nM14/21/39 EBR has been my favorite DMR in any game that features it, and BF6 was the first game in my entire library where I actually hated it. It was just awful to work with. The other DMR that was in the Beta was alright, at least a two hit kill on body, but it honestly felt like you were firing an Anzio 20mm or a Snipex Alligator.

{"id":"1myehur","title":"Why I think Battlefield 6 has a really strong launch lineup (and why DICE is on the right track)","selftext":"After reading all the info about BF6‚Äôs launch content, I honestly think DICE has a really solid foundation this time. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hyped about and why:\n\n* **Escalation mode** ‚Äì this could be a *really* fun new experience. If it‚Äôs dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.\n* **Maps** ‚Äì the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. I‚Äôm especially hyped for Egypt ‚Äì exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.\n* **Classes + weapon progression** ‚Äì finally we‚Äôll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.\n* **Portal** ‚Äì if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, that‚Äôs going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.\n* **Campaign** ‚Äì I‚Äôm genuinely happy we‚Äôre getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.\n* **Battle Royale** ‚Äì this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BF‚Äôs scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.\n* **Battle Pass** ‚Äì not much to say yet, but if it‚Äôs not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, it‚Äôll work fine.\n* **Ranked mode** ‚Äì I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.\n\nOverall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they don‚Äôt screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.\n\nI think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing."}

{"id":"1myd1p2","title":"Which has worse maps - BFV or 2042","selftext":"Question above, this is just me rambling what prompted me to ask\n\n\nSo just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.\n\nPlayed the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good \n\n I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify \n\nSo BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other?

{"id":"1myakrc","title":"Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging","selftext":"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50‚Äì60 FPS or higher. The point is, it‚Äôs not just the icon showing up ‚Äî when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don‚Äôt register on the enemy.\n\nIn reality, this isn‚Äôt exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.\n\nThis ‚Äúphantom lag‚Äù happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can‚Äôt keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning ‚Äî along with real gameplay lag.\n\n# The solution I found\n\nWhat pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:\n\n* **Plugged in**:\n   * SPL = 30W\n   * SPPT = 30W\n   * FPPT = 35W\n* **On battery**:\n   * SPL = 25W\n   * SPPT = 25W\n   * FPPT = 25W\n\nWith this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay anymore.\n\n# About packet loss\n\nI was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  \nUpgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference ‚Äî now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.\n\n# Why this works\n\n1. **Fixed power delivery** ‚Üí prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.\n2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** ‚Üí offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.\n   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.\n   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.\n\nüëâ In short:  \nStabilize your **power profiles** \\+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally."}

{"id":"1myakrc","title":"Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging","selftext":"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50‚Äì60 FPS or higher. The point is, it‚Äôs not just the icon showing up ‚Äî when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don‚Äôt register on the enemy.\n\nIn reality, this isn‚Äôt exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.\n\nThis ‚Äúphantom lag‚Äù happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can‚Äôt keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning ‚Äî along with real gameplay lag.\n\n# The solution I found\n\nWhat pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:\n\n* **Plugged in**:\n   * SPL = 30W\n   * SPPT = 30W\n   * FPPT = 35W\n* **On battery**:\n   * SPL = 25W\n   * SPPT = 25W\n   * FPPT = 25W\n\nWith this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay anymore.\n\n# About packet loss\n\nI was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  \nUpgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference ‚Äî now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.\n\n# Why this works\n\n1. **Fixed power delivery** ‚Üí prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.\n2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** ‚Üí offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.\n   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.\n   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.\n\nüëâ In short:  \nStabilize your **power profiles** \\+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally."}

This makes no sense at all. \n\nEA has tried in the past to create a Battle Royale mode for Battlefield, in this case, Firestorm in BFV. However, it failed because it wasn't free, and no one who buys BF wants to play that, just the classic experience. BF2042's Hazard Zone mode was an extraction mode, but it failed because BF2042 is...BF2042 , so the mode didn't even have a chance to do anything.\n\nLike every game company's goal, it wants to please existing players and attract new ones. BF6 is doing this; most people like it, and it's attracting a lot of people (especially those fleeing from BO7/Warzone). So a free mode also has this purpose, and if it's successful, it will attract players to buy the paid game. \n\nAnd this is very good for people who can't afford to pay $70 for a game and for people in third-world countries, which have lower purchasing power and a low-value currency. \n\nWarzone attracted a lot of people, but it also has some problems that Ripple Effect (the studio that will develop the mode) can't repeat:\n\n- Integrating multiple games into a single mode. Warzone has about 200 weapons, and that's impossible to balance.\n\n- Poor anti-cheat. \n\n- The game lacks its own identity; they change the movement and gunplay depending on the year's COD. \n\n- It's listened to by many streamers and content creators. \n\n- The game's philosophy has become basically a giant TDM. \n\n- Colored skins, even with the argument that it is a free game, harm the immersion and the purpose of the game.\n\n- Lack of content after launch\n\nWe have little information about the mode; we don't know if it will be integrated into BF6 or how it will play. But we'll have BF Labs testing. My guess is after BF6's release; they don't want this to dampen the game's hype. \n\nThere's a thought: if the mode is a success, EA will prioritize the free-to-play mode over the classic experience. Well, then, give me the lottery ticket, since you're predicting the future. We don't know what will happen and I think it's very unlikely.\n\nBut if Ripple Effect can create a mode that rewards team play, more tactical movement (not Milsim), sophisticated gunplay instead of a laser beam, has a lot of content, and maintains a more military feel, they already have a significant advantage over their competitors.\n\nAnd that would be very good for the franchise and the community.\n\nThat's my opinion on the matter. You have every right to disagree."}

Yes, the hate it gets are mostly justified, but what are some of the things (big or small) you think 2042 actually did right or you just like?\n\n  \nFor examples here are some things i personally really dig:     \n\n\\-The conquest \"sector\" system, its much easier to disrupt enemy majority or even turn the table around without needing to actually control more objectives than enemy. I think this has a lot of potentials to create some really interesting match outcomes when implemented well in certain maps.      \n\n\\-Skipping revive doesn't drain your timer is a welcome qol detail to me. In bfv and bf6 there are many times i cant reach and revive my squadmates in time because they skipped half their timer before i could tag them. The 2042 system makes it more streamlined for medics because basically all the people waiting for revives now have a much more consistent timer.        \n\n\\-Hourglass's sandstorm is not only visually stunning, i think its also the first time they finally find the balance between gimmick and gameplay. It only blocks your view for the first few seconds and it takes no time to return to sunny days. Making it more of a cool intermission event and don't feel like it could last half a match like in Sinai deserts.        \n\n\\-The announcers are underrated imo, coming from bf1 siri and bfv. I think its really cool that we now have multiple announcers working together as a team themselves, (i especially like the detail that sometimes announcer tells you how the match is going on because you overheard the commander asking for status report on the radio, not just because commander feels the need to tell you personally like in most other games). The briefing before matches also is an addition i didn't know i'd enjoy that much"}

{"id":"1myakrc","title":"Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging","selftext":"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50‚Äì60 FPS or higher. The point is, it‚Äôs not just the icon showing up ‚Äî when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don‚Äôt register on the enemy.\n\nIn reality, this isn‚Äôt exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.\n\nThis ‚Äúphantom lag‚Äù happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can‚Äôt keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning ‚Äî along with real gameplay lag.\n\n# The solution I found\n\nWhat pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:\n\n* **Plugged in**:\n   * SPL = 30W\n   * SPPT = 30W\n   * FPPT = 35W\n* **On battery**:\n   * SPL = 25W\n   * SPPT = 25W\n   * FPPT = 25W\n\nWith this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay anymore.\n\n# About packet loss\n\nI was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  \nUpgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference ‚Äî now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.\n\n# Why this works\n\n1. **Fixed power delivery** ‚Üí prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.\n2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** ‚Üí offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.\n   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.\n   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.\n\nüëâ In short:  \nStabilize your **power profiles** \\+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally."}

That stuff is trash and needs to go.\n\nI hate 2042, but the way that worked in that game is much better. If I am stuck with 3D spotting it's gotta chill out on marking players I cannot identify.

They look AMAZING, realistic, immersive, but it‚Äôs pretty much a guarantee that skins are going to be added that take away from the atmosphere. Look at the phantom edition skins (just a start, not inherently bad) and the gun skins in the 2042 free pass (which are pretty worrying). I think it‚Äôs fine to add these skins as long as we can choose not to see them on other people if we don‚Äôt want to. I think I can speak for most people here when I say I don‚Äôt wanna see that sht. I understand it‚Äôs not going to be anywhere near as bad as call of booty, but just add a slider. We are supposed to be in an immersive warzone. Seeing a blacked out dude with red, blue, purple trim and brightly colored guns takes away from that immersion and realism in a sense. And this slider shouldn‚Äôt disable all skins, just show all the BASE skins. If a player you encounter is wearing a post-launch skin just make it so they are wearing a random base-game skin. (There‚Äôs PLENTY of cool camos for each character) I‚Äôve seen an argument on the cod side of things about how not as many people would buy skins if everyone wasn‚Äôt forced to see them which means less money, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a significant enough argument nor do l think it‚Äôs fair at all.

{"id":"1my39lj","title":"Battle Royale vs Battlefield Community (my opinion).","selftext":"I want to talk a little about this discussion about BR mode and the BF community and how people act about it\n\nPeople have every right not to play the mode or dislike it, but to hope it fails just because you don't like it. This makes no sense at all. \n\nEA has tried in the past to create a Battle Royale mode for Battlefield, in this case, Firestorm in BFV. However, it failed because it wasn't free, and no one who buys BF wants to play that, just the classic experience. BF2042's Hazard Zone mode was an extraction mode, but it failed because BF2042 is...BF2042 , so the mode didn't even have a chance to do anything.\n\nLike every game company's goal, it wants to please existing players and attract new ones. BF6 is doing this; most people like it, and it's attracting a lot of people (especially those fleeing from BO7/Warzone). So a free mode also has this purpose, and if it's successful, it will attract players to buy the paid game. \n\nAnd this is very good for people who can't afford to pay $70 for a game and for people in third-world countries, which have lower purchasing power and a low-value currency. \n\nWarzone attracted a lot of people, but it also has some problems that Ripple Effect (the studio that will develop the mode) can't repeat:\n\n- Integrating multiple games into a single mode. Warzone has about 200 weapons, and that's impossible to balance.\n\n- Poor anti-cheat. \n\n- The game lacks its own identity; they change the movement and gunplay depending on the year's COD. \n\n- It's listened to by many streamers and content creators. \n\n- The game's philosophy has become basically a giant TDM. \n\n- Colored skins, even with the argument that it is a free game, harm the immersion and the purpose of the game.\n\n- Lack of content after launch\n\nWe have little information about the mode; we don't know if it will be integrated into BF6 or how it will play. But we'll have BF Labs testing. My guess is after BF6's release; they don't want this to dampen the game's hype. \n\nThere's a thought: if the mode is a success, EA will prioritize the free-to-play mode over the classic experience. Well, then, give me the lottery ticket, since you're predicting the future. We don't know what will happen and I think it's very unlikely.\n\nBut if Ripple Effect can create a mode that rewards team play, more tactical movement (not Milsim), sophisticated gunplay instead of a laser beam, has a lot of content, and maintains a more military feel, they already have a significant advantage over their competitors.\n\nAnd that would be very good for the franchise and the community.\n\nThat's my opinion on the matter. You have every right to disagree."}

{"id":"1my0g66","title":"Nothing's working and idk why","selftext":"I just got my first pc, and had a technician update everything, and it worked nice ok small games. But when the BF6 open beta started I had like 7 fps so I figured my gpu wasn't connected to my game, i searched online on how to make the game run, and turns out my drivers werent updated. After that i changed little things like my screen res and updated Windows defender and now nothing works.\nIs there anything I can do or do I need to call back tech support?\nBtw my pc has a amd ryzen 5 7600X, Sapphire Pulse Radeon 9060 XT, and 32gB ram."}

{"id":"1mxzl68","title":"Proof we really need server beowser or persistent servers","selftext":"I am just playing BF2042 and today I have been playing Breakthrough and I‚Äôve been keeping count.\n\nOut of 10 games I played, 8(!) of them were on Kaleidoscope. Goddamn 8 out 10 matches on the same one map. This is unacceptable in a game where there is like 15 maps.\n\nAnd this is exactly what we can look forward to in BF6 as it will be using the same matchmaking system."}
{"id":"1mxza3c","title":"Let's be nice for once, what are some things you like about 2042?","selftext":"Now that many of us, whether willingly or just grinding for the battlepass, have tried 2042 for nearly a week. Yes, the hate it gets are mostly justified, but what are some of the things (big or small) you think 2042 actually did right or you just like?\n\n  \nFor examples here are some things i personally really dig:     \n\n\\-The conquest \"sector\" system, its much easier to disrupt enemy majority or even turn the table around without needing to actually control more objectives than enemy. I think this has a lot of potentials to create some really interesting match outcomes when implemented well in certain maps.      \n\n\\-Skipping revive doesn't drain your timer is a welcome qol detail to me. In bfv and bf6 there are many times i cant reach and revive my squadmates in time because they skipped half their timer before i could tag them. The 2042 system makes it more streamlined for medics because basically all the people waiting for revives now have a much more consistent timer.        \n\n\\-Hourglass's sandstorm is not only visually stunning, i think its also the first time they finally find the balance between gimmick and gameplay. It only blocks your view for the first few seconds and it takes no time to return to sunny days. Making it more of a cool intermission event and don't feel like it could last half a match like in Sinai deserts.        \n\n\\-The announcers are underrated imo, coming from bf1 siri and bfv. I think its really cool that we now have multiple announcers working together as a team themselves, (i especially like the detail that sometimes announcer tells you how the match is going on because you overheard the commander asking for status report on the radio, not just because commander feels the need to tell you personally like in most other games). The briefing before matches also is an addition i didn't know i'd enjoy that much"}

{"id":"1mxytta","title":"New player to Battlefield, queueing but lobby remains empty, is there a way to fix it?","selftext":"I recently got BF2042 on Steam sale.\n\nI've watched several people stream the games before but am a new player to the franchise.\n\nI did the intro conquest mission and tried queueing on 64 player conquest map, but the count maybe goes up to 3 and then drops back down to 1/64.\n\nIs there a way to search for fuller lobbies or servers that have more active players?\n\nDo I need to level up more to find matches with more people in it or how can I play this game?\n\nI tried one match with bots when the lobby stayed empty for 20 mins, but I'm thinking of refunding and maybe rather getting something else as I wanted to play PVP FPS BF style game, like Battlebit. I enjoyed it!\n\nI'm also not sure if I'll be spending money at the premium price point of BF6, if this is how low the interest in Battlefield is in my region, without any server browser or wider matchmaking. I don't mind playing at 150ms ping or anything below 250ms, if it means I get to play. But this game does not seem to give that option.\n\nI mostly play for fun, not competitive.\n\nI wanted to play this in anticipation for BF6 but seeing how few people play this here in South Africa, even on a weekend and a 95% sale. It leaves me a little hesitant to spend 80 dollars on BF6 when it comes out."}
