{"id":"1myx23q","title":"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers","selftext":"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.\n\nFor basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.\n\nHere‚Äôs why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:\n\n* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It‚Äôs frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.\n* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That‚Äôs why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It‚Äôs not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it‚Äôs the only way they can ‚Äúbalance‚Äù sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. \n* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads‚Äîcovering the 300‚Äì600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.\n* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they‚Äôre not every squad‚Äîthey‚Äôre specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they‚Äôd work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.\n* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.\n* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won‚Äôt be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.\n\nBattlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I‚Äôm fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.\n\nWhat do you all think?"}

I‚Äôve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).\n\nAfter BO6, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I‚Äôm well aware those trailers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the multiplayer.\n\nYesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.\n\nMy takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn‚Äôt fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).\nI loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it‚Äôs supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we‚Äôre getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay‚Äîand so much fun.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm optimistic, but of course I‚Äôll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true.

Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

Makes it too much like Warzone\".\n\nYet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.\n\nI know that there are \"night\" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?\n\nThe only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this. Idk, seems like a cool experience the devs could create, and I haven't really seen this in any other multiplayer game, except maybe Tarkov but that's almost an other genre."}

{"id":"1myx23q","title":"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers","selftext":"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.\n\nFor basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.\n\nHere‚Äôs why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:\n\n* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It‚Äôs frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.\n* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That‚Äôs why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It‚Äôs not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it‚Äôs the only way they can ‚Äúbalance‚Äù sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. \n* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads‚Äîcovering the 300‚Äì600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.\n* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they‚Äôre not every squad‚Äîthey‚Äôre specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they‚Äôd work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.\n* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.\n* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won‚Äôt be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.\n\nBattlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I‚Äôm fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.\n\nWhat do you all think?"}

(presumably, if I also set a new personal best in kills during that same round, for example, the game might choose to display _that_, instead.)\n\nduring post-round, you get the little icon squares that display score, kills, deaths, and assists... **could we add an icon square for Revives, as well?**\n\n&nbsp; \n\nPTFO and revivng allies are two of the things that make the Battlefield series unique; as such, we should _never_ end a round without knowing how many caps and revives we notched!\n\nthanks for reading!"}

I‚Äôve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).\n\nAfter BO6, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I‚Äôm well aware those trailers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the multiplayer.\n\nYesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.\n\nMy takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn‚Äôt fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).\nI loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it‚Äôs supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we‚Äôre getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay‚Äîand so much fun.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm optimistic, but of course I‚Äôll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let‚Äôs hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins). \n\nFeel free to share your opinion.\n"}

{"id":"1myrrno","title":"2042 is still a trash game","selftext":"I was wondering what is happening in r/battlefield2042. So much praise for the game recently and I was like \"do we play the same game, especially after the BF6 beta?\"\n\nMaps are fucking horrendous. So many of them are literally just barren, empty spaces, even the smaller 64 player versions. Especially the desert maps like Hourglass, El Alamein and Discarded. There is ZERO cover between capture points.\n\nAnd this leads me to my next point: The TOR tank. Yep, this thing, depsite its \"nerf\", is game breaking in my opinion. Not only is it a shit concept, but it's also frustrating. You want to transport people with your MAV or Brawler around? Good luck with a TOR camping on a hill on El Alamein overlooking the entire map. Yep, I got killed multiple times over the weekend by these players. And the best thing is, they don't even have to leave their safe space aka the HQ, so not much you can do. Helicopter? Forget it, a Wildcat is sitting right next to it and some dudes as well who repair both. Peak gameplay.\n\n  \nAlso so many other garbage concepts like Liz with her stupid TV missile, often getting kills without even needing line of sight. Wonderful.\n\nNah man, don't let people tell you this is a \"good game\" by now. **It is a fixed, functional game**. But a garbage game nontheless. The only reason I play this steaming pile of shit are the BF6 rewards. It is fucking torture."}

{"id":"1myr349","title":"Incase you're like me and have either not been able to redeem the Twitch Drops and/or Support has been a useless bunch of bots - Telling someone on console to use the \"in game support system'.. Follow these steps to get your rewards!","selftext":"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

Every time I come back to it, I get the same feeling I had when I first played it all those years ago.\n\nNowadays, everything has to look as realistic as possible and honestly, I think that sucks the soul out of a lot of games and movies.

Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

My favorite thing to do in this franchise is to fly attack helos while mic‚Äôed up with a good gunner as we support our team, ideally on hardcore mode without of that 3D spotting nonsense.\n\nI have since watched the franchise go through its evolution (?) and am aware there‚Äôs a new game coming out. I don‚Äôt own a PC, console, or even a TV, but I‚Äôd happily find a way to play if BF6 will incorporate attack helicopters the way BF2-4 did.\n\nTwo war stories: \n\nI once barrel rolled a Havoc underneath gas pipelines in Zatar Wetlands after wiping out an armor column and drawing enemy fire, with a few feet of clearance above and below.\n\nMy irl brother chased a SU-32 with a TV guided missile after it strafed our Viper over the Kubra Dam‚Ä¶ put it right up\nthe Flanker‚Äôs tailpipe.\n\nBattlefield has given us so many of these amazing moments and I‚Äôd love to get a few more!

This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}

Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.\n\nI know that there are \"night\" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?\n\nThe only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this.

{"id":"1myx23q","title":"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers","selftext":"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.\n\nFor basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.\n\nHere‚Äôs why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:\n\n* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It‚Äôs frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.\n* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That‚Äôs why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It‚Äôs not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it‚Äôs the only way they can ‚Äúbalance‚Äù sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. \n* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads‚Äîcovering the 300‚Äì600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.\n* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they‚Äôre not every squad‚Äîthey‚Äôre specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they‚Äôd work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.\n* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.\n* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won‚Äôt be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.\n\nBattlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I‚Äôm fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.\n\nWhat do you all think?"}

I‚Äôve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).\n\nAfter BO6, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I‚Äôm well aware those trailers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the multiplayer.\n\nYesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.\n\nMy takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn‚Äôt fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).\nI loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it‚Äôs supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we‚Äôre getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay‚Äîand so much fun.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm optimistic, but of course I‚Äôll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let‚Äôs hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins). \n\nFeel free to share your opinion.\n"}

There is ZERO cover between capture points.\n\nAnd this leads me to my next point: The TOR tank. Yep, this thing, depsite its \"nerf\", is game breaking in my opinion. Not only is it a shit concept, but it's also frustrating. You want to transport people with your MAV or Brawler around? Good luck with a TOR camping on a hill on El Alamein overlooking the entire map. Yep, I got killed multiple times over the weekend by these players. And the best thing is, they don't even have to leave their safe space aka the HQ, so not much you can do. Helicopter? Forget it, a Wildcat is sitting right next to it and some dudes as well who repair both.

I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.\n\n- \"Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone\".\n\nYet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

{"id":"1mymplk","title":"Medic went from the best it‚Äôs ever been to the worst, and it‚Äôs too late to fix it","selftext":"Aside from the admittedly excellent dragging mechanic, as a medic main from way back, I‚Äôm definitely disappointed in the Battlefield 6 medic experience, and it‚Äôs all because DICE muddied up the class system. \n\nIn Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.\n\nI know that there are \"night\" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?\n\nThe only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this. Idk, seems like a cool experience the devs could create, and I haven't really seen this in any other multiplayer game, except maybe Tarkov but that's almost an other genre."}
