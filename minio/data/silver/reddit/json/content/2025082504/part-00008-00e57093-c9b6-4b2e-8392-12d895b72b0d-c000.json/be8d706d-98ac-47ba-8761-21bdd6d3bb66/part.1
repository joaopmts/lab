{"id":"1mzfe2d","title":"Is it even possible for BF6 to remain grounded or realistic?","selftext":"A big part of the excitement for BF6 is it being more grounded/realistic. Both in comparison to recent Battlefield titles, and the extreme excesses of other shooters. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to sustain that.\n\nThe rewards for the Phantom Edition confirm the game will have Battle Passes. It‚Äôs also likely to feature a cosmetic shop as other shooters nowadays do. If BF6 is going to receive years of support, that means numerous Battle Passes full of cosmetics, and a shop constantly updated constantly. Thereby requiring a consistent flow of skins enticing enough to draw the common player to purchase.\n\nConsidering that, I don‚Äôt know if maintaining the current aesthetic is possible. There‚Äôs only so far you can stretch the tacti-cool aesthetic. Even if you take larger steps like adding unrealistic patterns and colors. Not only that, multiple Battle Passes and shops all full of the same style of skin may not be appealing to the average player, especially if they grow tired of it or don‚Äôt gel with it. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt to say it‚Äôll reach the CoD extremes of anime and Nicki Minaj skins. But I wonder if the loss of consistent aesthetics in shooters is partly an inevitable result of the model adapted, and if BF6 will suffer the same fate. "}

I realize they are very different beasts, but I legitimately think ranked ruined Apex. Over time, even the lowest ranked tiers became just unplayable by average casual gamers like myself and my friends. \"Bronze\" meant nothing because after dozens of resets and iterations of the ranking system, that skill floor went up and up and up.\n\nI think BF6 should stick with NO ranked mode. Focus on preventing cheating, honing things like movement and believability to keep the spirit of \"this is a war game where you play with your squad\" alive."}

{"id":"1mzb59y","title":"I think people misunderstand how spotting works in BF6","selftext":"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but based on my experience in the BF6 beta, I‚Äôve noticed a distinction between when an enemy is marked within your line of sight and when they are actually spotted. When an enemy is within a specific cone radius related to your crosshairs, an indicator appears above their head to assist YOU alone in identifying them as an enemy. This is NOT the same as spotting someone. To spot an enemy for your team to see, you must physically ping them, which alerts other players to their location. I've observed many people mistakenly assume that the indicator above an enemy's head means they are automatically spotted for the entire team. The only class that can auto-spot enemies is Recon. I just wanted to clarify this point. Again, please correct me if I'm mistaken."}

I may be controversial saying this, but this section seems a bit too stuck to their ideals of what Battlefield should be and don‚Äôt like the direction it‚Äôs going in.\n\nLastly, you have the ‚Äúnewer‚Äù players from BF1 onwards who love the faster gameplay and definitely enjoy/praise the atmosphere of the recent games despite both BFV and 2042 having rocky launches. It seems as though these players tend to suggest to add more out there things to the game like the weather system in 2042 to bf6 and generally seem to be somewhat disliked by the other two groups for not really conforming to their set-in-stone ideals of battlefield. \n\nI feel like the community is somewhat at war right now and I feel like DICE is doing the right thing by trying to listen but at the same time 1) we‚Äôve only played a Beta so things will change 2) if we pull them in too many directions it might negatively impact the game.

I recently bought a 9950X3D which the previous owner delided and used liquid metal. I did so because he was selling it for a price of 9950X, and it sounded like a good deal. \n\nI thought what could possibly go wrong, CPUs dont usually go bad, and the seller said he will reglue the IHS. \n\nWhen it arrived, I put it into a brand new motherboard (ASUS X870 MAX GAMING WIFI 7) together with Arctic liquid freezer iii 360 AIO. Tested everything works correctly and went onto playing BF6 beta. \n\nRight there was when I noticed the temps were not that nice, averaging around 85C while the CPU was pulling somewhere between 100-120W iirc. When running Cinebench 2024, and under full load, the CPU power was around 162W tops while the temps were hitting 95C. My idle temperature is around 52C. \n\nAlthough I know the CPUs are designed for these temps and my cinebench score was roughly the same as other peoples on the internet, it still kinda sucks. \n\nI have tried repasting twice, didnt make a noticable difference. Is there a chance the seller reglued the IHS wrong? One thing i definitely noticed is, that the seller probably used liquid metal even between the IHS and the cooler, as the top of the IHS looks weird. It looks like small drops of liquid metal are on it. Maybe that is what causes bad contact with the AIO. \n\nI tried cleaning it with the wipes that come with MX-6 thermal paste bundle, but thats obviously not going to do anything if its metal. Before I resort to some really dumb potentially destructive methods, i wanted to ask a second opinion.\n\nThe picture below shows the CPU after all the cleaning attempts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5raffqnra1lf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=56b4d998a26589f4179e982989e69a396f0659bb\n\n"}

I could still hear sounds but had no controls and the only thing I could do was hard reboot. This happened twice last week, once on Saturday and once on Sunday, while playing the BF6 beta... I chocked it up to the game being in the beta phase since I had read about the game crashing for others as well. Except last night I hard rebooted and tried again and immediately was met with the same black screen as soon as I started the game. This happened 3 times. So I gave up and went to bed. I only have time to game on the weekends currently and during the week my PC doesn't usually get used lately.\n\nThis morning I took my pc apart to check the power connection, make sure my GPU was seated correctly in the PCI slot, even swapped the power cable with one my sons PC wasn't using. Everything seemed to be just like it was when I built it in January. Put it back together and started it up and it seemed like it took longer than usual. I also noticed that the MSI Afterburner icon was gone on my desktop. When I tried to open it, it told me that the file couldn't be located or something along those lines. Definitely didn't delete it as I was running it and Riva Tuner while playing last night. Tried to run Delta Force and it was also uninstalled. At this ppint PC started freezing and the only thing I could do was hard reboot it again. \n\nI took the GPU out and just used iGPU and it seemed like it started working just fine. Until it didn't... but as you know, seemingly anything failing all produces relatively the same symptoms so I decided to start trying to check things off the list. Took one stick of ram out, seemed to work better. Tested ram through Windows, no issues. Installed 2nd stick again and retested, no issues. Downloaded Memtest86 and ran 4 passes with both sticks, no errors besides noticing that the BIOS update must have reverted my ram back to 4800 rather than the 6000 it was running previously.\n\nLast weekend I installed a Windows update and the update through Nvidia, so I went ahead and updated my BIOS cuz you know 9800X3D and Asrock motherboard. So I knew everything was up to date but I still went ahead and completely uninstalled everything Nvidia with Revo bc I could not uninstall Afterburner or Riva due to the files not being located. Reinstalled the GPU and Nvidia App and drivers. Again seemed to work okay for about an 30 minutes and as soon as I went to install Delta Force it froze again.\n\nDid this a time or 2 and then I started getting a red light on mobo for Boot and VGA.

{"id":"1mz6s4b","title":"Black ops 6 was LOVED at launch and months after. What happened?","selftext":"It was not at all uncommon to see thr sentiment of \"best cod in years\" and praising things like omni movement. If we are being honest here, its one of the best playing shooters ever made. \n\nCods gameplay is always stellar quality wise, its fine if you prefer certain styles im purely talking on a technical level and polish, how all the mechanics feel to use. Does this move, this gun, this climb, all feel good and do what I expect when I expect it. There is ZERO \"realistic\", (talking not things like halo or destiny) shooters that match its quality and polish of a cod game. Even battlefield 6, a game I liked, is behind on just the basics by a lot a lot. Even things like recoil and vaulting feel off in bf6.  Quality and gameplay polish, is just something call of duty has over everyone. That doesn't mean the choices they make design wise, or money wise, are good. But raw gameplay polish and production values are factually unbeaten. Games like halo infinite and destiny 2 are the only other games that have such hyper polished gameplay. \n\nOmni movement is a pretty notable improvement snd innovation to basic fps gameplay. Allowing players to vary their movement speed in multiple directions, just makes sense. Like REAL people would move. We as human beings are not limited by sprinting one speed, and only forward. I think its REALLY bizzare that some people now act like omnimovement is \"less grounded and realistic\" when its objectively more realistic but I digress. Just because its not likely a soldier would dive into a room and start shooting instead of slowly peaking doorways, does not mean having that be a movement option, is unrealistic. Its the opposite.  \n\nThat being saiiiiiiddddd. Why does EVERYONE change their tune on cod by the end of its lifespan? I can understand people hating the skins. But otherwise? I dont get it. It seems UNIVERSAL for all call of duty games and has been since the orginallll mw2. \n\nLook, I dont like the skins and battlepasses either. And I am NOT a huge cod fan at all. Im much more into halo, always have been. Was a screw call of duty guy, when halo 3 was head to head with cod 4, waw,  and mw2. Certified cod hater. Would feel dirty as a teenager every time id play it, like I was betraying my beloved halo 3. \n\nBut I quite like the new cods since the new mw2019. Wasn't a big fan of mw3. But black ops 6 I think is just fucking awesome to play. I adore the 90s action movie vibe and gameplay. Theres nothing cooler than diving out of a second story window and getting s kill on the way down. It FEELS incredible to pull off. It doesnt eve feel clunky, I never accidentally do a movement I dont want to do, Its great. \n\nSo yeah, again, dont get it. "}

{"id":"1mz2ghm","title":"Going back to BFV is a much better experience than 6.","selftext":"BF1 was tops for me. Game was amazing at launch with few issues. Dice LA came in and changed the TTK, and from there it's a bit more controversial. Some people liked their changes, others feel they didn't need to be made. LA refined a few things and released pretty cool DLC for the most part.\n\nI happen to think medics are too OP in both 1 and V, and that is probably the major issue nobody fixed with them. But hey they are still amazing games in the golden period of Dice. The Sweden team was so talented.\n\nV was not great on release, with maps that just did not make sense in way too many areas. It took them ages to balance anything properly. Tanks being basically immortal really HURT the game for a long time.\n\nThe TTK is decently fast, but it's the fastest I would want out of anything with big maps. I am very good with meta weapons, but by the time I abandoned it, like 60 hours in, the game was just not great, and things were being nerfed. Now the ZH and Type 2 and other weapons are tops, and it's a new ball game for me. \n\nI thought BF6 was a decent beta and a game I would never buy on release. Worse than V in almost every way. The revive animations were amazing though. Yet why would I buy something like this on release? Those maps were not great. The best one, Cairo, was basically Amiens without the end zones lol. And a worse immersive experience as well with very little room to move anywhere. \n\nNow coming back to V, this game is still going strong on console especially. Holy shit there were over 1000 people in US servers yesterday on PS.\n\nI booted it up on my PC too, and the graphics are definitely a little step up with DXR and ray tracing being decent on PC. Not as many people but still servers going.\n\nThe consoles sadly did not get a next gen patch, DAMN YOU EA!, but they also run really well at least. Thank god they got a PS4 Pro patch or we'd be stuck with the garbage BF4 quality that they let go to shite.\n\nRegardless, this is the actual Battlefield game I wanted. And I really was not happy with the game on release. If only they released a few more maps for this WW2 game that doesn't feel like WW2 at all on a lot of the maps.\n\nBut it really proves just how bad the maps are on 6. Pacific Storm rolls over any map in BF6 by such large margin it's not even funny. It's sad. And I have almost no hope for 6 in the future. MAYBE a year after release it will become a decent BF that isn't chasing COD. Maybe the timeline of V will be what 6 follows, but from what we hear they plan on abandoning these games pretty fast in the future. Whatever I guess.\n\nAll the bots and AI on Reddit could not convince me to buy 6."}

Both in comparison to recent Battlefield titles, and the extreme excesses of other shooters. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to sustain that.\n\nThe rewards for the Phantom Edition confirm the game will have Battle Passes. It‚Äôs also likely to feature a cosmetic shop as other shooters nowadays do. If BF6 is going to receive years of support, that means numerous Battle Passes full of cosmetics, and a shop constantly updated constantly. Thereby requiring a consistent flow of skins enticing enough to draw the common player to purchase.\n\nConsidering that, I don‚Äôt know if maintaining the current aesthetic is possible. There‚Äôs only so far you can stretch the tacti-cool aesthetic. Even if you take larger steps like adding unrealistic patterns and colors. Not only that, multiple Battle Passes and shops all full of the same style of skin may not be appealing to the average player, especially if they grow tired of it or don‚Äôt gel with it. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt to say it‚Äôll reach the CoD extremes of anime and Nicki Minaj skins.

When an enemy is within a specific cone radius related to your crosshairs, an indicator appears above their head to assist YOU alone in identifying them as an enemy. This is NOT the same as spotting someone. To spot an enemy for your team to see, you must physically ping them, which alerts other players to their location. I've observed many people mistakenly assume that the indicator above an enemy's head means they are automatically spotted for the entire team. The only class that can auto-spot enemies is Recon. I just wanted to clarify this point. Again, please correct me if I'm mistaken."}

I may be controversial saying this, but this section seems a bit too stuck to their ideals of what Battlefield should be and don‚Äôt like the direction it‚Äôs going in.\n\nLastly, you have the ‚Äúnewer‚Äù players from BF1 onwards who love the faster gameplay and definitely enjoy/praise the atmosphere of the recent games despite both BFV and 2042 having rocky launches. It seems as though these players tend to suggest to add more out there things to the game like the weather system in 2042 to bf6 and generally seem to be somewhat disliked by the other two groups for not really conforming to their set-in-stone ideals of battlefield. \n\nI feel like the community is somewhat at war right now and I feel like DICE is doing the right thing by trying to listen but at the same time 1) we‚Äôve only played a Beta so things will change 2) if we pull them in too many directions it might negatively impact the game.

I recently bought a 9950X3D which the previous owner delided and used liquid metal. I did so because he was selling it for a price of 9950X, and it sounded like a good deal. \n\nI thought what could possibly go wrong, CPUs dont usually go bad, and the seller said he will reglue the IHS. \n\nWhen it arrived, I put it into a brand new motherboard (ASUS X870 MAX GAMING WIFI 7) together with Arctic liquid freezer iii 360 AIO. Tested everything works correctly and went onto playing BF6 beta. \n\nRight there was when I noticed the temps were not that nice, averaging around 85C while the CPU was pulling somewhere between 100-120W iirc. When running Cinebench 2024, and under full load, the CPU power was around 162W tops while the temps were hitting 95C. My idle temperature is around 52C. \n\nAlthough I know the CPUs are designed for these temps and my cinebench score was roughly the same as other peoples on the internet, it still kinda sucks. \n\nI have tried repasting twice, didnt make a noticable difference. Is there a chance the seller reglued the IHS wrong? One thing i definitely noticed is, that the seller probably used liquid metal even between the IHS and the cooler, as the top of the IHS looks weird. It looks like small drops of liquid metal are on it. Maybe that is what causes bad contact with the AIO. \n\nI tried cleaning it with the wipes that come with MX-6 thermal paste bundle, but thats obviously not going to do anything if its metal. Before I resort to some really dumb potentially destructive methods, i wanted to ask a second opinion.\n\nThe picture below shows the CPU after all the cleaning attempts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5raffqnra1lf1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=56b4d998a26589f4179e982989e69a396f0659bb\n\n"}

I could still hear sounds but had no controls and the only thing I could do was hard reboot. This happened twice last week, once on Saturday and once on Sunday, while playing the BF6 beta... I chocked it up to the game being in the beta phase since I had read about the game crashing for others as well. Except last night I hard rebooted and tried again and immediately was met with the same black screen as soon as I started the game. This happened 3 times. So I gave up and went to bed. I only have time to game on the weekends currently and during the week my PC doesn't usually get used lately.\n\nThis morning I took my pc apart to check the power connection, make sure my GPU was seated correctly in the PCI slot, even swapped the power cable with one my sons PC wasn't using. Everything seemed to be just like it was when I built it in January. Put it back together and started it up and it seemed like it took longer than usual. I also noticed that the MSI Afterburner icon was gone on my desktop. When I tried to open it, it told me that the file couldn't be located or something along those lines. Definitely didn't delete it as I was running it and Riva Tuner while playing last night. Tried to run Delta Force and it was also uninstalled. At this ppint PC started freezing and the only thing I could do was hard reboot it again. \n\nI took the GPU out and just used iGPU and it seemed like it started working just fine. Until it didn't... but as you know, seemingly anything failing all produces relatively the same symptoms so I decided to start trying to check things off the list. Took one stick of ram out, seemed to work better. Tested ram through Windows, no issues. Installed 2nd stick again and retested, no issues. Downloaded Memtest86 and ran 4 passes with both sticks, no errors besides noticing that the BIOS update must have reverted my ram back to 4800 rather than the 6000 it was running previously.\n\nLast weekend I installed a Windows update and the update through Nvidia, so I went ahead and updated my BIOS cuz you know 9800X3D and Asrock motherboard. So I knew everything was up to date but I still went ahead and completely uninstalled everything Nvidia with Revo bc I could not uninstall Afterburner or Riva due to the files not being located. Reinstalled the GPU and Nvidia App and drivers. Again seemed to work okay for about an 30 minutes and as soon as I went to install Delta Force it froze again.\n\nDid this a time or 2 and then I started getting a red light on mobo for Boot and VGA. Took graphics card out again. Even switched to a HDMI cable as that's the only extra cable I had on hand atm and it booted through once and then froze on the desktop. Now its even struggling to boot if it even willl. \n\nWindows says my M.2 is healthy.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure what to think..."}

{"id":"1mz6s4b","title":"Black ops 6 was LOVED at launch and months after. What happened?","selftext":"It was not at all uncommon to see thr sentiment of \"best cod in years\" and praising things like omni movement. If we are being honest here, its one of the best playing shooters ever made. \n\nCods gameplay is always stellar quality wise, its fine if you prefer certain styles im purely talking on a technical level and polish, how all the mechanics feel to use. Does this move, this gun, this climb, all feel good and do what I expect when I expect it. There is ZERO \"realistic\", (talking not things like halo or destiny) shooters that match its quality and polish of a cod game. Even battlefield 6, a game I liked, is behind on just the basics by a lot a lot. Even things like recoil and vaulting feel off in bf6.  Quality and gameplay polish, is just something call of duty has over everyone. That doesn't mean the choices they make design wise, or money wise, are good. But raw gameplay polish and production values are factually unbeaten. Games like halo infinite and destiny 2 are the only other games that have such hyper polished gameplay. \n\nOmni movement is a pretty notable improvement snd innovation to basic fps gameplay. Allowing players to vary their movement speed in multiple directions, just makes sense. Like REAL people would move. We as human beings are not limited by sprinting one speed, and only forward. I think its REALLY bizzare that some people now act like omnimovement is \"less grounded and realistic\" when its objectively more realistic but I digress. Just because its not likely a soldier would dive into a room and start shooting instead of slowly peaking doorways, does not mean having that be a movement option, is unrealistic. Its the opposite.  \n\nThat being saiiiiiiddddd. Why does EVERYONE change their tune on cod by the end of its lifespan? I can understand people hating the skins. But otherwise? I dont get it. It seems UNIVERSAL for all call of duty games and has been since the orginallll mw2. \n\nLook, I dont like the skins and battlepasses either. And I am NOT a huge cod fan at all. Im much more into halo, always have been. Was a screw call of duty guy, when halo 3 was head to head with cod 4, waw,  and mw2. Certified cod hater. Would feel dirty as a teenager every time id play it, like I was betraying my beloved halo 3. \n\nBut I quite like the new cods since the new mw2019. Wasn't a big fan of mw3. But black ops 6 I think is just fucking awesome to play. I adore the 90s action movie vibe and gameplay. Theres nothing cooler than diving out of a second story window and getting s kill on the way down. It FEELS incredible to pull off. It doesnt eve feel clunky, I never accidentally do a movement I dont want to do, Its great. \n\nSo yeah, again, dont get it. "}

{"id":"1mz2ghm","title":"Going back to BFV is a much better experience than 6.","selftext":"BF1 was tops for me. Game was amazing at launch with few issues. Dice LA came in and changed the TTK, and from there it's a bit more controversial. Some people liked their changes, others feel they didn't need to be made. LA refined a few things and released pretty cool DLC for the most part.\n\nI happen to think medics are too OP in both 1 and V, and that is probably the major issue nobody fixed with them. But hey they are still amazing games in the golden period of Dice. The Sweden team was so talented.\n\nV was not great on release, with maps that just did not make sense in way too many areas. It took them ages to balance anything properly. Tanks being basically immortal really HURT the game for a long time.\n\nThe TTK is decently fast, but it's the fastest I would want out of anything with big maps. I am very good with meta weapons, but by the time I abandoned it, like 60 hours in, the game was just not great, and things were being nerfed. Now the ZH and Type 2 and other weapons are tops, and it's a new ball game for me. \n\nI thought BF6 was a decent beta and a game I would never buy on release. Worse than V in almost every way. The revive animations were amazing though. Yet why would I buy something like this on release? Those maps were not great. The best one, Cairo, was basically Amiens without the end zones lol. And a worse immersive experience as well with very little room to move anywhere. \n\nNow coming back to V, this game is still going strong on console especially. Holy shit there were over 1000 people in US servers yesterday on PS.\n\nI booted it up on my PC too, and the graphics are definitely a little step up with DXR and ray tracing being decent on PC. Not as many people but still servers going.\n\nThe consoles sadly did not get a next gen patch, DAMN YOU EA!, but they also run really well at least. Thank god they got a PS4 Pro patch or we'd be stuck with the garbage BF4 quality that they let go to shite.\n\nRegardless, this is the actual Battlefield game I wanted. And I really was not happy with the game on release. If only they released a few more maps for this WW2 game that doesn't feel like WW2 at all on a lot of the maps.\n\nBut it really proves just how bad the maps are on 6. Pacific Storm rolls over any map in BF6 by such large margin it's not even funny. It's sad. And I have almost no hope for 6 in the future. MAYBE a year after release it will become a decent BF that isn't chasing COD. Maybe the timeline of V will be what 6 follows, but from what we hear they plan on abandoning these games pretty fast in the future. Whatever I guess.\n\nAll the bots and AI on Reddit could not convince me to buy 6."}

When an enemy is within a specific cone radius related to your crosshairs, an indicator appears above their head to assist YOU alone in identifying them as an enemy. This is NOT the same as spotting someone. To spot an enemy for your team to see, you must physically ping them, which alerts other players to their location. I've observed many people mistakenly assume that the indicator above an enemy's head means they are automatically spotted for the entire team. The only class that can auto-spot enemies is Recon.

I may be controversial saying this, but this section seems a bit too stuck to their ideals of what Battlefield should be and don‚Äôt like the direction it‚Äôs going in.\n\nLastly, you have the ‚Äúnewer‚Äù players from BF1 onwards who love the faster gameplay and definitely enjoy/praise the atmosphere of the recent games despite both BFV and 2042 having rocky launches.

I did so because he was selling it for a price of 9950X, and it sounded like a good deal. \n\nI thought what could possibly go wrong, CPUs dont usually go bad, and the seller said he will reglue the IHS. \n\nWhen it arrived, I put it into a brand new motherboard (ASUS X870 MAX GAMING WIFI 7) together with Arctic liquid freezer iii 360 AIO. Tested everything works correctly and went onto playing BF6 beta. \n\nRight there was when I noticed the temps were not that nice, averaging around 85C while the CPU was pulling somewhere between 100-120W iirc. When running Cinebench 2024, and under full load, the CPU power was around 162W tops while the temps were hitting 95C. My idle temperature is around 52C. \n\nAlthough I know the CPUs are designed for these temps and my cinebench score was roughly the same as other peoples on the internet, it still kinda sucks. \n\nI have tried repasting twice, didnt make a noticable difference. Is there a chance the seller reglued the IHS wrong? One thing i definitely noticed is, that the seller probably used liquid metal even between the IHS and the cooler, as the top of the IHS looks weird. It looks like small drops of liquid metal are on it. Maybe that is what causes bad contact with the AIO. \n\nI tried cleaning it with the wipes that come with MX-6 thermal paste bundle, but thats obviously not going to do anything if its metal.

I could still hear sounds but had no controls and the only thing I could do was hard reboot. This happened twice last week, once on Saturday and once on Sunday, while playing the BF6 beta... I chocked it up to the game being in the beta phase since I had read about the game crashing for others as well. Except last night I hard rebooted and tried again and immediately was met with the same black screen as soon as I started the game. This happened 3 times. So I gave up and went to bed. I only have time to game on the weekends currently and during the week my PC doesn't usually get used lately.\n\nThis morning I took my pc apart to check the power connection, make sure my GPU was seated correctly in the PCI slot, even swapped the power cable with one my sons PC wasn't using. Everything seemed to be just like it was when I built it in January. Put it back together and started it up and it seemed like it took longer than usual. I also noticed that the MSI Afterburner icon was gone on my desktop. When I tried to open it, it told me that the file couldn't be located or something along those lines. Definitely didn't delete it as I was running it and Riva Tuner while playing last night. Tried to run Delta Force and it was also uninstalled. At this ppint PC started freezing and the only thing I could do was hard reboot it again. \n\nI took the GPU out and just used iGPU and it seemed like it started working just fine. Until it didn't... but as you know, seemingly anything failing all produces relatively the same symptoms so I decided to start trying to check things off the list. Took one stick of ram out, seemed to work better. Tested ram through Windows, no issues. Installed 2nd stick again and retested, no issues. Downloaded Memtest86 and ran 4 passes with both sticks, no errors besides noticing that the BIOS update must have reverted my ram back to 4800 rather than the 6000 it was running previously.\n\nLast weekend I installed a Windows update and the update through Nvidia, so I went ahead and updated my BIOS cuz you know 9800X3D and Asrock motherboard. So I knew everything was up to date but I still went ahead and completely uninstalled everything Nvidia with Revo bc I could not uninstall Afterburner or Riva due to the files not being located. Reinstalled the GPU and Nvidia App and drivers. Again seemed to work okay for about an 30 minutes and as soon as I went to install Delta Force it froze again.\n\nDid this a time or 2 and then I started getting a red light on mobo for Boot and VGA. Took graphics card out again. Even switched to a HDMI cable as that's the only extra cable I had on hand atm and it booted through once and then froze on the desktop. Now its even struggling to boot if it even willl. \n\nWindows says my M.2 is healthy.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure what to think..."}

{"id":"1mz6s4b","title":"Black ops 6 was LOVED at launch and months after. What happened?","selftext":"It was not at all uncommon to see thr sentiment of \"best cod in years\" and praising things like omni movement. If we are being honest here, its one of the best playing shooters ever made. \n\nCods gameplay is always stellar quality wise, its fine if you prefer certain styles im purely talking on a technical level and polish, how all the mechanics feel to use. Does this move, this gun, this climb, all feel good and do what I expect when I expect it. There is ZERO \"realistic\", (talking not things like halo or destiny) shooters that match its quality and polish of a cod game. Even battlefield 6, a game I liked, is behind on just the basics by a lot a lot. Even things like recoil and vaulting feel off in bf6.  Quality and gameplay polish, is just something call of duty has over everyone. That doesn't mean the choices they make design wise, or money wise, are good. But raw gameplay polish and production values are factually unbeaten. Games like halo infinite and destiny 2 are the only other games that have such hyper polished gameplay. \n\nOmni movement is a pretty notable improvement snd innovation to basic fps gameplay. Allowing players to vary their movement speed in multiple directions, just makes sense. Like REAL people would move. We as human beings are not limited by sprinting one speed, and only forward. I think its REALLY bizzare that some people now act like omnimovement is \"less grounded and realistic\" when its objectively more realistic but I digress. Just because its not likely a soldier would dive into a room and start shooting instead of slowly peaking doorways, does not mean having that be a movement option, is unrealistic. Its the opposite.  \n\nThat being saiiiiiiddddd. Why does EVERYONE change their tune on cod by the end of its lifespan? I can understand people hating the skins. But otherwise? I dont get it. It seems UNIVERSAL for all call of duty games and has been since the orginallll mw2. \n\nLook, I dont like the skins and battlepasses either. And I am NOT a huge cod fan at all. Im much more into halo, always have been. Was a screw call of duty guy, when halo 3 was head to head with cod 4, waw,  and mw2. Certified cod hater. Would feel dirty as a teenager every time id play it, like I was betraying my beloved halo 3. \n\nBut I quite like the new cods since the new mw2019. Wasn't a big fan of mw3. But black ops 6 I think is just fucking awesome to play. I adore the 90s action movie vibe and gameplay. Theres nothing cooler than diving out of a second story window and getting s kill on the way down. It FEELS incredible to pull off. It doesnt eve feel clunky, I never accidentally do a movement I dont want to do, Its great. \n\nSo yeah, again, dont get it. "}

Dice LA came in and changed the TTK, and from there it's a bit more controversial. Some people liked their changes, others feel they didn't need to be made. LA refined a few things and released pretty cool DLC for the most part.\n\nI happen to think medics are too OP in both 1 and V, and that is probably the major issue nobody fixed with them. But hey they are still amazing games in the golden period of Dice. The Sweden team was so talented.\n\nV was not great on release, with maps that just did not make sense in way too many areas. It took them ages to balance anything properly. Tanks being basically immortal really HURT the game for a long time.\n\nThe TTK is decently fast, but it's the fastest I would want out of anything with big maps. I am very good with meta weapons, but by the time I abandoned it, like 60 hours in, the game was just not great, and things were being nerfed. Now the ZH and Type 2 and other weapons are tops, and it's a new ball game for me. \n\nI thought BF6 was a decent beta and a game I would never buy on release. Worse than V in almost every way. The revive animations were amazing though. Yet why would I buy something like this on release? Those maps were not great. The best one, Cairo, was basically Amiens without the end zones lol. And a worse immersive experience as well with very little room to move anywhere. \n\nNow coming back to V, this game is still going strong on console especially. Holy shit there were over 1000 people in US servers yesterday on PS.\n\nI booted it up on my PC too, and the graphics are definitely a little step up with DXR and ray tracing being decent on PC. Not as many people but still servers going.\n\nThe consoles sadly did not get a next gen patch, DAMN YOU EA!, but they also run really well at least. Thank god they got a PS4 Pro patch or we'd be stuck with the garbage BF4 quality that they let go to shite.\n\nRegardless, this is the actual Battlefield game I wanted. And I really was not happy with the game on release. If only they released a few more maps for this WW2 game that doesn't feel like WW2 at all on a lot of the maps.\n\nBut it really proves just how bad the maps are on 6. Pacific Storm rolls over any map in BF6 by such large margin it's not even funny. It's sad. And I have almost no hope for 6 in the future. MAYBE a year after release it will become a decent BF that isn't chasing COD. Maybe the timeline of V will be what 6 follows, but from what we hear they plan on abandoning these games pretty fast in the future. Whatever I guess.\n\nAll the bots and AI on Reddit could not convince me to buy 6."}

(This new update is pretty good and that's the quality we should have been giving throughout 2042). "}

Battlefield has its own satisfying traditional gun sway animation in every battlefield but now it looks like cod a lot. Downvote me all you want but its true the animations look like call of duty. And battlefield should not copy that. Let each others games have there own sprinting gun sway animations and not copy each other. And battlefield wants to LOOK like cod. And Dont get wrong i like Vince zampla but he should stay in making story modes and campaigns and NOT be involved in the multiplayer cuz remember he was a excod guy that made cod games like Mw2 and cod 2 and cod3. Dont forget about that"}

Simply because the people in the vehicle exited sub seconds before my last shot. I don‚Äôt know the exact numbers about this or how it was in previous battlefields but this was happening more in bf6. The fix to this might be a slight delay for exiting vehicles or vehicle explosion splash damage. That‚Äôs up to you. But it needs to be fixed."}
