{"id":"1my39lj","title":"Battle Royale vs Battlefield Community (my opinion).","selftext":"I want to talk a little about this discussion about BR mode and the BF community and how people act about it\n\nPeople have every right not to play the mode or dislike it, but to hope it fails just because you don't like it. This makes no sense at all. \n\nEA has tried in the past to create a Battle Royale mode for Battlefield, in this case, Firestorm in BFV. However, it failed because it wasn't free, and no one who buys BF wants to play that, just the classic experience. BF2042's Hazard Zone mode was an extraction mode, but it failed because BF2042 is...BF2042 , so the mode didn't even have a chance to do anything.\n\nLike every game company's goal, it wants to please existing players and attract new ones. BF6 is doing this; most people like it, and it's attracting a lot of people (especially those fleeing from BO7/Warzone). So a free mode also has this purpose, and if it's successful, it will attract players to buy the paid game. \n\nAnd this is very good for people who can't afford to pay $70 for a game and for people in third-world countries, which have lower purchasing power and a low-value currency. \n\nWarzone attracted a lot of people, but it also has some problems that Ripple Effect (the studio that will develop the mode) can't repeat:\n\n- Integrating multiple games into a single mode. Warzone has about 200 weapons, and that's impossible to balance.\n\n- Poor anti-cheat. \n\n- The game lacks its own identity; they change the movement and gunplay depending on the year's COD. \n\n- It's listened to by many streamers and content creators. \n\n- The game's philosophy has become basically a giant TDM. \n\n- Colored skins, even with the argument that it is a free game, harm the immersion and the purpose of the game.\n\n- Lack of content after launch\n\nWe have little information about the mode; we don't know if it will be integrated into BF6 or how it will play. But we'll have BF Labs testing. My guess is after BF6's release; they don't want this to dampen the game's hype. \n\nThere's a thought: if the mode is a success, EA will prioritize the free-to-play mode over the classic experience. Well, then, give me the lottery ticket, since you're predicting the future. We don't know what will happen and I think it's very unlikely.\n\nBut if Ripple Effect can create a mode that rewards team play, more tactical movement (not Milsim), sophisticated gunplay instead of a laser beam, has a lot of content, and maintains a more military feel, they already have a significant advantage over their competitors.\n\nAnd that would be very good for the franchise and the community.\n\nThat's my opinion on the matter. You have every right to disagree."}

Yes, the hate it gets are mostly justified, but what are some of the things (big or small) you think 2042 actually did right or you just like?\n\n  \nFor examples here are some things i personally really dig:     \n\n\\-The conquest \"sector\" system, its much easier to disrupt enemy majority or even turn the table around without needing to actually control more objectives than enemy. I think this has a lot of potentials to create some really interesting match outcomes when implemented well in certain maps.      \n\n\\-Skipping revive doesn't drain your timer is a welcome qol detail to me. In bfv and bf6 there are many times i cant reach and revive my squadmates in time because they skipped half their timer before i could tag them. The 2042 system makes it more streamlined for medics because basically all the people waiting for revives now have a much more consistent timer.        \n\n\\-Hourglass's sandstorm is not only visually stunning, i think its also the first time they finally find the balance between gimmick and gameplay. It only blocks your view for the first few seconds and it takes no time to return to sunny days. Making it more of a cool intermission event and don't feel like it could last half a match like in Sinai deserts.        \n\n\\-The announcers are underrated imo, coming from bf1 siri and bfv. I think its really cool that we now have multiple announcers working together as a team themselves, (i especially like the detail that sometimes announcer tells you how the match is going on because you overheard the commander asking for status report on the radio, not just because commander feels the need to tell you personally like in most other games). The briefing before matches also is an addition i didn't know i'd enjoy that much"}

{"id":"1mxxd1r","title":"BF2042 is more enjoyable than BF4 for me","selftext":"Note how I said ‚Äúfor me‚Äù. Opinions are different for everyone but I feel I need to state this as BF2042 was always highly criticized. \nLet me start by saying I‚Äôve played and own all BF‚Äôs, my favorite being BF3. \nWe all know the comment ‚ÄúBF4 is just BF3 but more polished‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be more untrue. \nBF3 had much more enjoyable maps, assignments and core mechanics. \nNot only that, but the graphics and overall visuals / color palette hold up better. BF4 also tends to have buggy textures and overall worse graphics. \nBut let‚Äôs focus this thread on the comparison between BF4 and 2042. BF4 suffers from a horrible netcode and lag. I can‚Äôt even state how many times I was running behind cover while shot and got killed while I was already Ls‚Äùsafe‚Äù. Hitmark detection in 4 is bad. Also too many times when I see an enemy appear in my screen for a split second, I‚Äôm already dead. I recorded multiple clips to analyze this phenomenon and I was right. Maybe because I have extremely low ping (1000mbps fibre glass internet) and the opponent or BF server is laggy.  \nWhatever the reason, it‚Äôs really shitty. Combat and gunplay become really annoying. \n2042 on the other hand is buttery smooth and a 1:1 representation of how your brain perceives things. It‚Äôs just much more up to date and modern feeling. \nAnother thing I can‚Äôt stand about bf4 is how the maps in my opinion mostly suck. Everyone is wild about shanghai, but in my eyes it‚Äôs just some skyscrapers and some roads with a bridge.. don‚Äôt get me started on 24/7 golmud maps. Golmud is a shit map, there I said it. \nI actually believe that 2042 maps are more enjoyable than a lot of bf4 maps (inb4 downvotes, idc). \nSpearhead gives me this very open feeling and gives me windows xp fever dream vibes. Orbital has an actual rocket launch during the battle. Overall I think the maps are a little blend but still give a lot of play room for different tactics and approaches. And they look gorgeous. \nThe gadgets in 2042 give the player a shitton of cool new ways to battle the enemy. For example using a guided rocket to take down a chopper with your controller is much more interesting and effective than just aiming an igla, waiting for the aircraft to deploy flares and then try again..\nI do hate the whole specialist characters in 2042 but the gear is better. \n\nIf I wanted the old school BF maps and vibes I‚Äôll just play my baby BF3. BF4 just seems like a very confused release with bad maps.. I mean there are some good dlc maps like dragon valley but no server rolls these maps. It‚Äôs mostly flood, golmud, metro etc. \nBf4 graphics, lag and netcode are also horrible imo. \nNot to forget that the game became really sweaty. Tons of vehicle campers, people using team resources like jets to get their asses up a skyscraper just to snipe and be useless etc‚Ä¶\n\nAgain, this was not meant as a war between the two games, but more to show people 2042 is actually really good (now) and I couldn‚Äôt imagine going back to bf4. \n\nTo sum it all up; gameplay and gunplay wise, 2042 is much more correct and smooth. Combat is satisfying and more fair. Requires skills, less (or no) netcode failure. Maps in my eyes are very interesting. Serene, futuristic but not over the top. People call it a walking simulator. That‚Äôs really a far stretch and I love them more than the maps we‚Äôve seen in the bf6 beta. I love the gadgets giving you unique ways to play. Graphics are very refreshing and high quality. \n\nThe reason for this thread was primarily to encourage more people to try out 2042. It received so much criticism while it‚Äôs actually a smooth, crisp, intelligent and fair Battlefield game. Especially wanted to put an emphasis on this since a lot of people are on BF4, just like I was, not knowing better. But in retrospect, BF4 is just a buggy, laggy ugly mess. If I want the old school BF feel and maps, I‚Äôll go to BF3 which is much better in every way. "}

Here's the story\n\n2 weeks ago I installed Battlefield 6 open Beta. It required me to enable Safe Boot ; for that I had to update my BIOS. Then I had to update my GPU drivers, which I did via the AMD software, as usual. No other changes were made, and I was able to play the game for the weekend.\n\nIn the following week and up until now, i've had multiple BSOD that are have a rather unpredictable timing : they can happen on the window login screen, or I can browse for hours on Firefox without any crash, go take a shit, and then boom, BSOD while the PC is idle.\n\nThe BSOD have a different message each time, but it's always a \"visually glitched\" BSOD (think 4 BSOD on the upper screen, and a \"mosaic of what was on the screen before the crash\" on the bottom).\n\nHere is what I have tried so far :\n\n\\- Restore to a \"before BF6\" => no effect on BSOD\n\n\\- clean uninstall and reinstall of AMD drivers => no effect on BSOD\n\n\\- updated BIOS to the latest non-beta version => no effect on BSOD\n\n\\- ran memtest86 on my only RAM stick = no error detected (2 pass)\n\n\\- ran Window's memory diag tool => no error detectedf (full test)\n\n\\- ran windows repair tools (chdsk, dism, sfc) => no effect on BSOD\n\n\\- reinstalled Windows (while keeping my data, not the clean slate reinstall) => no effect on BSOD\n\n\\- ran Verifier to check non-window drivers => 2 crashes so far, one a few minutes after boot, the other a few hours after boot.\n\n\\-Ran Windows antivirus on full scan => found only 3 old trojans i've had for years.\n\nUp until two days ago i was using WhoCrashed to read the DMP files, but it was not very helful, as the crash types are all over the place. Now i'm using BlueScreenviewer and it's consistenly targeting \"ntoskrnl.exe+3fd510\", which if i'm understanding correctly, is Windows \"master driver\", although it could be not directly linked to this, but rather to something it's trying to access/use (right ?).\n\nI have not done anything yet on the hardware side yet.\n\nI don't know what more to do to find the root of the issue. Can you guys help me ?

{"id":"1myx23q","title":"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers","selftext":"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.\n\nFor basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.\n\nHere‚Äôs why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:\n\n* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It‚Äôs frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.\n* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That‚Äôs why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It‚Äôs not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it‚Äôs the only way they can ‚Äúbalance‚Äù sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. \n* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads‚Äîcovering the 300‚Äì600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.\n* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they‚Äôre not every squad‚Äîthey‚Äôre specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they‚Äôd work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.\n* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.\n* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won‚Äôt be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.\n\nBattlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns. It would be truer to real tactics, better for balance, and way less miserable to play against. Please make it happen. I know I‚Äôm fighting decades of tradition by suggesting this, but I think it would breathe new life into the series.\n\nWhat do you all think?"}

(presumably, if I also set a new personal best in kills during that same round, for example, the game might choose to display _that_, instead.)\n\nduring post-round, you get the little icon squares that display score, kills, deaths, and assists... **could we add an icon square for Revives, as well?**\n\n&nbsp; \n\nPTFO and revivng allies are two of the things that make the Battlefield series unique; as such, we should _never_ end a round without knowing how many caps and revives we notched!\n\nthanks for reading!"}

I‚Äôve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).\n\nAfter BO6, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I‚Äôm well aware those trailers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the multiplayer.\n\nYesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.\n\nMy takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn‚Äôt fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).\nI loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it‚Äôs supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we‚Äôre getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay‚Äîand so much fun.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm optimistic, but of course I‚Äôll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let‚Äôs hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins). \n\nFeel free to share your opinion.\n"}

So many of them are literally just barren, empty spaces, even the smaller 64 player versions. Especially the desert maps like Hourglass, El Alamein and Discarded. There is ZERO cover between capture points.\n\nAnd this leads me to my next point: The TOR tank. Yep, this thing, depsite its \"nerf\", is game breaking in my opinion. Not only is it a shit concept, but it's also frustrating. You want to transport people with your MAV or Brawler around? Good luck with a TOR camping on a hill on El Alamein overlooking the entire map. Yep, I got killed multiple times over the weekend by these players. And the best thing is, they don't even have to leave their safe space aka the HQ, so not much you can do. Helicopter? Forget it, a Wildcat is sitting right next to it and some dudes as well who repair both. Peak gameplay.\n\n  \nAlso so many other garbage concepts like Liz with her stupid TV missile, often getting kills without even needing line of sight. Wonderful.\n\nNah man, don't let people tell you this is a \"good game\" by now. **It is a fixed, functional game**. But a garbage game nontheless.

Follow these steps to get your rewards!","selftext":"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

{"id":"1mymplk","title":"Medic went from the best it‚Äôs ever been to the worst, and it‚Äôs too late to fix it","selftext":"Aside from the admittedly excellent dragging mechanic, as a medic main from way back, I‚Äôm definitely disappointed in the Battlefield 6 medic experience, and it‚Äôs all because DICE muddied up the class system. \n\nIn Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}

{"id":"1myx23q","title":"Recon should be reconfigured to use DMRs as their default weapon, not snipers","selftext":"The way snipers have been implemented in *Battlefield* has been broken for years. BF6 is the perfect opportunity to fix it.\n\nFor basically every iteration of the series, Recon has meant camping on a hill or rooftop and not playing the objective. A quarter of the classes is essentially dedicated to playing their own minigame instead of being in the same fight as everyone else. The game would be much healthier if every class were part of the front line instead only three of them.\n\nHere‚Äôs why I think Recon should be reconfigured around **DMRs as their default class weapon** instead of snipers:\n\n* **Sniper spam is toxic and unfun.** Entire hillsides of glinting players add nothing to objective play. It‚Äôs frustrating to play against and frustrating to rely on them as teammates. Snipers are effectively playing their own minigame instead of actually being in the same sphere as the rest of the players.\n* **Even DICE knows sniper spam is a problem.** That‚Äôs why they've taken this heavy-handed approach to nerfing snipers with hyperbolic scope glint for multiple *Battlefield* entries now. It‚Äôs not only unrealistic but also makes playing as a sniper annoying, but it‚Äôs the only way they can ‚Äúbalance‚Äù sniper spam without rethinking the class structure. \n* **DMRs make more sense vis-a-vis real-life squad formation.** In real squad tactics, designated marksmen are integrated into infantry squads‚Äîcovering the 300‚Äì600m fight with precision fire. Bolt-action snipers are rare specialist teams employed to take out high-value targets.. Switching Recon to DMRs would give them a **distinct role** (precision mid-range support) that complements Assault and doesn't render 1/4 of the available classes to being useless (at least with their default weapon class) on smaller maps.\n* **True snipers should be limited assets.** In real life, they‚Äôre not every squad‚Äîthey‚Äôre specialist 2-man teams used to pick off high-value targets. In-game, they‚Äôd work better if they were rare and limited, just like vehicles. Imagine a handful of sniper slots per team instead of entire squads wasting slots in the hills.\n* **Recon class equipment already benefits being closer to the front lines.** The T-UGS, proximity sensors, the new UAV scan in BF6 actually wants to push Recon to being on the frontlines. *Battlefield 6* is the perfect opportunity to finally make Recon a normal class instead of a meme. Now they'll have much more incentive to actually use that utility to help their team instead of camping in the back.\n* **By limiting snipers, we can close the in-game performance gap between snipers and DMRs.** As it stands, dedicated sniper rifles are in this weird spot where they only one-shot on a headshot, which renders them kind of useless at mid-range when you can just use a DMR instead. If both are two-shots, why use a bolt-action outside of maximal range? With limited snipers, we can also undo the heavy-handed nerf of scope glint, as well, and turn snipers into the stealthy, HVT-killing specialists they are in real life. Snipers would also be more fun to play knowing you don't light up like a Christmas tree every time you aim. Incidentally, these changes would actually make sniping more rewarding and fun since it won‚Äôt be burdened by stopgap measures to nerf them.\n\nBattlefield has been trying to paper over the sniper issue for multiple titles now, but BF6 could actually solve it by rethinking Recon entirely. Give them DMRs as their bread and butter. Make bolt-action sniper rifles a limited team resource like vehicle spawns.

I‚Äôve thoroughly played every single installment (though the newer ones not as extensively).\n\nAfter BO6, which I didn‚Äôt enjoy as much for various reasons (maps, skins, super chaotic gameplay, etc.), I had little hope for the new entry and hopped on the BF6 hype train instead. The BO7 reveal trailer pretty much confirmed my feelings, although I‚Äôm well aware those trailers don‚Äôt necessarily reflect the multiplayer.\n\nYesterday, I took the time to watch the short clips on IG and read through the written reveal on the website.\n\nMy takeaway: Treyarch actually managed to get me interested for now and even distracted me from BF6 (whose beta just didn‚Äôt fully convince me from a gameplay perspective).\nI loved BO2, and even played BO3/BO4 much longer than the more recent installments. BO7 feels like a mix of those, and according to media reports, it‚Äôs supposedly the game Treyarch has wanted to make for years. On top of that, we‚Äôre getting classics like Raid, Express, and Hijacked, plus weapons like the M8A1, Rampart, Peacekeeper, etc. But even the new maps and weapons look aesthetically promising. The titles I mentioned above were absolutely top-tier in terms of gameplay and gunplay‚Äîand so much fun.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm optimistic, but of course I‚Äôll wait for the beta to see if my current feelings hold true. Let‚Äôs hope that Treyarch and Activision will deliver (no silly skins). \n\nFeel free to share your opinion.\n"}

There is ZERO cover between capture points.\n\nAnd this leads me to my next point: The TOR tank. Yep, this thing, depsite its \"nerf\", is game breaking in my opinion. Not only is it a shit concept, but it's also frustrating. You want to transport people with your MAV or Brawler around? Good luck with a TOR camping on a hill on El Alamein overlooking the entire map. Yep, I got killed multiple times over the weekend by these players. And the best thing is, they don't even have to leave their safe space aka the HQ, so not much you can do. Helicopter? Forget it, a Wildcat is sitting right next to it and some dudes as well who repair both. Peak gameplay.\n\n  \nAlso so many other garbage concepts like Liz with her stupid TV missile, often getting kills without even needing line of sight.

Follow these steps to get your rewards!","selftext":"#     MODS: If this Post is an issue, or somehow goes against some sort of Rule I didn't see, I apologize! I'm simply trying to help those who have yet to be able to redeem their rewards before the cut off date tomorrow, August 25/25\n\n\n\nSo, I've basically reached my witts end with the countless back and forth with the Support Bots - I mean Team? I guess?? Regarding not being able to connect my DF account to twitch, in order to redeem the Drops via twitch viewership rewards.\n\n  At first, I was told to follow the steps on this page by somone in the discord (I believe, or may have been a bot via email) - [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:\\~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html#:~:text=STEP%201,WATCH%20NOW)\n\n  \nAt the very bottom of the page, it mentions under #6. \"How to Unbind My Account\" - to hit the unbind  button at the top of the page. Unfortunately, said button does not exist! I've been doing the whole Twitch drop thing for ages, and I've never encountered a clusted \"mess\" quite like this. Usually, it's as simple as logging into Twitch, going to \"connections\" under your settings. From there, you look for the specific Developer you want to remove from having a connection for you Twitch account. \n\n  \n  Unforutnately,  for myself and what seems like countless others - these steps simple don't work, What's worse it's as if the Developers or rather folks in charge of the technical end of things over at Delta Force somehow managed to mangle the connection between loads of accounts and twitch in such a way that it's not even possible to claim these rewards under your normal twitch account. \n\n  \n  However, I found a fix! I'll add screenshots, taken in the last hour or two that prove this process does indeed work. It's worth noting, that the entire time, my \"own\" twitch accoint that is many years old is and was at the time of redeeming these drops via a second account, connected to \"Delta Force App\". \n\n  \n  ***What you need to do to get your drops on to your account:***\n\n*    First off, you'll need to create a fresh Twitch account.  ***I would recommend using A. a different browser, but not a VPN - seems DF's website doesn't like it when you sign in with a VPN!***\n*   Now, unfortunately, I'm not sure whether this process is random or what - however, you may be required to use a second phone number to set up this twitch account. You could always explain to a family member what the situation is and ask if you cna use there's. There are also services out there, reputable ones, that provide a legit texting service for these exact situations.\n*   Once this twitch account is created, just tune into some random streamer or you favorite streamer who currently has \"Drops Enabled\". Once two hours of having the stream sit has passed, you've now qualified for the 9 or so drops.\n*  \n*   At this point,  in the same browser, I'd recommend opening a new tab and logging into your main twitch account, the one you originally used to try and get these drops, under settings you want to look for connections and then just press CTRL+F and type Delta - You'll see \"**Delta Force App\". You want  to Disconnect! (To be fair, my account is still connected to not only my main twitch account where i had issues, but also my new/secondary account and they are still both connected. You  may be able to skip this step but likely best to take the time and do the couple extra steps!).** \n\n*   \\*\\*\\* You'll want to make sure that before you click on \"Connect\" (show on the the left hand side of the list of drops, you do indeed have an account setup @ Delta Forces \"Level Infitite\" Webiste - [https://pass.levelinfinite.com/](https://pass.levelinfinite.com/) (Confusing, right? Yeah. I don't get it either!!! But I believe this is the Developers way of keeping one website for signins for all their games, who knows...). Furthermore, since this developer doesn't have their website setup properly for console players to sign in using the PSN or Xbox accounts (like most developers out there), I feel it's very important that the email used to sign in to your delta force account is the ***SAME email address used on your PSN/Xbox (MS LIVE???) account.*** Something tells me that this is rather imperative, and not something we can just chose not to do! I could be wrong though!!! \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n* Also, fair warning - On the level infinite website, I personally do not do the whole enter my email address and then enter the code they send to that email address in order to sign in, Instead, I prefer to chose the \"Login with email and password\" option, I've found it to give me less issues, specifically when trying to redeem these drops!\n*   Once logged in, switch back over to the twitch drops page, click \"Connect\" or you can likely just click on \"Claim\" on one of the items you're trying to redeem! You should now be looking at the DF page, [https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html](https://www.playdeltaforce.com/act/twitchdrops/index.html) where you should see your email that you signed in with, only some/most of it with have \\*\\*\\* blocking the personal info on screen. Now, you can simply click on \"Step #2\" which will redirect you to a twitch page, asking permission to connect the \"Delta Force App\" to your account. Accept that.\n*   After you've completed all those steps, which to be fair, isn't as bad as I make it out to be - you should now either have possibly redeemed all drops by click \"claim\" and the connecting the account or it's possible you now need need to claim each individually! Give it about 5-10 minutes, boot up or restart your game and check the mailbox. You should have confirmation of the Twitch Drops being added to your account. \n*   **HOWEVER, YOU AREN'T DONE YET: Incase you havne't realized, this game seems to love to make us work for these rewards. So make sure you go through each of the messages and \"Claim\" the rewards!**\n\n  \n   Thats it! Hopefully tis worked for you like it did for me! A bit irritating to say the least and absolutely frustrating that we've been forced to go trhough this sort of thing just to get a couple twitch drops. If you ask me, if they weren't ready for Console Support, they should have waited! But that's a whole other topic!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4y4m8bqyqxkf1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=4521fae78f76ad0c266dfc27a1f7543ac48afa57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj2ekjh2rxkf1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=03bc484fd65ece4cb7e002a6ed6b1a1a492f5f39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wavmt0y3rxkf1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54350a9ed0546e49fcb588de8de9277970b7840\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45s1dom5rxkf1.jpg?width=1540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93eee760357355a712b5a7b785638920c23c04d4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erqgofz6rxkf1.jpg?width=3582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90d5e399f541a65fcfb10d224d214e61e9737e9a\n\n"}

Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.\n\nI also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that.

I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof.

{"id":"1myomiz","title":"Some things I think this community needs to hear.","selftext":"I've been playing zombies since WaW. Probably the biggest fan of the OG stuff. I also realize zombies isn't meant to be exactly the same through every iteration but people will complain nonetheless.\n\n- \"Armor shouldn't exist in zombies! Makes it too much like Warzone\".\n\nYet a ton of you had seemingly nothing wrong with MWIII Zombies, and that was literally just DMZ with zombies. If you don't like armor, don't use it. Its not required.\n\n- \"Why would I not use armor, thats stupid\"\n\nYou're asking for zombies to be more challenging. Setting restrictions for yourself can make it more challenging. You don't want to go down in 2 hits without armor, but you also want it more challenging??? Make up your mind or get good.\n\n- \"You shouldn't be able to spawn in with your own loadout. Makes the mystery box useless\".\n\nFair point. Then make your loadout gun a pistol with no attachments and set your main weapon to a zombie build and farm it from the mystery box the normal way. Theres literally nothing stopping you from doing this.\n\n- \"Weapon rarity sucks\".\n\nNo it just adds depth to the game. In all the older games it was just about getting to PaP and spending your 5K points. Then you have no use for them the rest of the game. Adding salvage and extra PaP tiers makes games feel longer because points have more of a purpose. Its addicting because it's a more rewarding system.\n\n- \"BO7 Tranzit is lazy, only one survival map on launch and fog still exists\".\n\nThe fog isn't as obstructive (according to roflwaffles) and BO2 did the same thing on launch. The difference is BO2 Tranzit was awful. This iteration opens it up more which is automatically a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\n- \"Zombies is cooked this year, I'm buying BF6\"\n\nOkay, well the game isn't out yet and we havent had the beta either. If you hate it so much from a glance, why are you even on this subreddit?\n\nThese aren't taken word for word or anything but I have seen many complaints on this subreddit about these specific topics. Zombies is evolving guys, and i suppose that's the reason there's a whole community still playing BO3 custom maps. Yall don't want to change with the times. Thats fine but at least give it a chance first. Personally, I'm optimistic about this installment. I think ill stay that way."}

{"id":"1mymplk","title":"Medic went from the best it‚Äôs ever been to the worst, and it‚Äôs too late to fix it","selftext":"Aside from the admittedly excellent dragging mechanic, as a medic main from way back, I‚Äôm definitely disappointed in the Battlefield 6 medic experience, and it‚Äôs all because DICE muddied up the class system. \n\nIn Battlefield 5 you had limited self-healing, which made medics both essential to the team and gave them a very powerful advantage on their own. This was balanced by them having more limited range than every other class and no offensive gadgets. It was almost perfect, a big improvement over the overpowered assault-medics of BF3 and BF4, and it‚Äôs so disappointing that they dropped the strongest class design in the series for this. No one cares about healing in BF6 because you can simply sit behind a wall for a few seconds and be fine. \n\nSadly, I don‚Äôt see this changing too much at this point because it‚Äôs a casualty of other design decisions. Since the support and medic classes are combined and all weapons are open to everyone, the healing can‚Äôt be too too strong of an advantage, because the devs don‚Äôt have the tools to balance it out anymore. If they simply increased the time to auto-heal, support would end up the most played class by a mile. The advantage in survivability would make you the best front-liner and the best sniper. You‚Äôd only have to change to engineer to take care of vehicles.\n\nThis approach of trying not to inconvenience the player, giving them access to every weapon and making them self-sufficient has generally eroded class identity and the feeling of team play, but it has absolutely killed healing as a mechanic.

Not ONLY that, it also allows you to copy and paste a simple text string to copy a person's loadout (provided you have the weapon XP for relevant attachments) and try a build for yourself.\n\nIt is the simplest and most elegant method of gun building I have encountered in a game, and with the customizations allowed in BF6, I would personally love to see a similar system implemented."}

I've tried it in 2021 and refunded it after a few hours, now I rebought it for 3‚Ç¨ to unlock skins in bf6. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the map design in the game.  \nIt's either open plains with very little cover, through which you have to run for hundreds of meters on foot to get to the next objective (because simple transport vehicles like jeeps, quads and dirtbikes are in short supply for some reason, despite the maps being huge) - this makes you just a sitting duck for snipers and vehicles or everyone who sees you and you can be shot from either direction... and why is the terrain so flat and open on so many maps? \n\nOr it's the other extreme, narrow corridors where both teams end in a stalemate, spam smokes and explosives and when you try to push through, you have 10 guns pointed at you and you immediately die. \n\nThe only map that I've actually liked and had fun on so far is Iwo Jima on Conquest. There was enough cover, I could choose engagement distances and move around somewhat freely. Everything else was either terrible or serviceable at best.  \n\nIf you enjoy the maps in 2042, good for you.

Going from a game like Battlefield 1 or to a lesser extent BFV, where the clarity and natural beauty of the game was able to shine in both sweaty gameplay and cinematics, to BF6's very dark, gloomy, unnatural colors and shading I think is exacerbating that feeling that I'm just too old to keep up with what's going on on the screen.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think."}
