Cause it got refunded within 2 hours/ 4 Online games.

Where do I start? 

\#1) Ping/Server issues.... I played 4 online games, all over 60+ ping (I get 20-30 in EVERY other game I play, even less with some like Fortnite/OW). The passing was delayed, the animations were SO emphasized, and I felt like my players were playing in Ice the whole time... Which I felt I had very little control over my defenders.... Which leads me to point #2

\#2) Defense and Defenders.... I have NEVER had an easier time passing 97 VVD then I did today. All 4 games had SEVERAL goals within 30 minutes. I had one game.... 13-9.... another 12-5, and another 12-6 (all wins btw, still didnt have fun)....This is coming from past games where I pride myself in defending, but no matter WHAT setting I did... I felt like I could not defend AT ALL... and my Ops were the same way

\#3) WHY ARE THEY GIVING US TOTW 97's TO TEST THE GAME??? the whole point is to play the game with low level cards like we would at the start..... Why give me 99 Pace Mbappe that can run around all of the team without anyone stopping him? and that leads to #4

\#4) Dribbling and Offense is CRRAAZZZYYYY strong.... the fact that there was a goal in EVERY GAME within the first kickoff was nuts, legit every game started with a kickoff goal. The ""run down the line cut back"" meta is still there, dribbling felt WAY too good on a player like Hansen, she shouldnt just R1 run and sprint around the whole pitch....

All and All, I still see the SAME glaring issues that plagued FC25 and I simply cannot put myself thru another year of this game. SO glad I got a chance to save myself the pain, onto BF6 and Borderlands 4 :)

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof.

Puske i pucanje su odlicne (tu je po meni za neke puske manja zamerka malo slabiji recoil ali to mogu da poprave do oktobra, mada je to EA pa se nikad ne zna), mape su po meni sasvim zadovoljavajuce mada bi trebali da dodaju nekoliko vecih mapa do izlaska igrice. 
Jedina prava zamerka su kola, motori, tenkovi i tome slicno (jel'te po engleski vehicles) po meni mogu neki put da budu jako teska da se kontrolisu a nekad su kao da vozis kola u gta 5, isto se na nekim mapama spawn-uje previse kola/motora/helikoptera pa onda gameplay bude da izbegnes sve kamikaze koje lete po mapi a ne da se fokusiras na zadatak koji ti je dat te runde.

1mwuwff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwuwff/as_a_dominationkoth_exclusive_enjoyer_bf6_is/,,1,"As a Domination/KOTH Exclusive Enjoyer, BF6 Is ALMOST Perfect",GarageDoorOpener2,False,True,False,,False,"As someone who doesn't usually play Battlefield, playing BF6's Call of Duty-esque game modes was extremely enjoyable for me. For the first time in a long time, I got my casual balls to the walls brainrot fix from Domination and KOTH, something that I didn't think was going to happen. Obviously, I know the wider Battlefield community will not be playing it all that much, but I got a lot of BO2 and XDefiant vibes from these game modes and it made me sit down for nearly ten hours straight on the first day of global beta access. 

It also helped that it still had some Battlefield flavor with revives, support, and a stronger emphasis on objective play. I really liked how I could slay out and cap flags or push hills at the same time, while pulling my squadmates away from gunfire so my team would have more help putting pressure on the enemies. It was always very satisfying to see myself on the top of the scoreboard of my team almost every single time because the way these modes are set up makes it very easy to do both simultaneously. It's real good fun.

There are a couple of issues with these game modes, though, and I think they're actually pretty simple to implement.

The first thing I would change is to actually make the respawn timer longer. In contrast to Conquest, these game modes have it where you can respawn immediately after being downed, and then the game decides where you spawn as opposed to picking your spawn yourself.

Now, I really like games where I can die and immediately get back in with very little downtime, which, if I'm being honest, is why Battlefield never really caught my interest in the past. But, I would argue that the timer to respawn is too quick. Because the objective is more pronounced in Battlefield as opposed to other games, having as many people around the objective is a good strat if you're trying to get time on the hill during KOTH for example.

So what ends up happening is that in most lobbies, people tend to forego reviving or dropping medpacks because its assumed that you'll just spawn right back in. But this is counter intuitive because the game usually spawns you pretty far away from the objective after dying, which means that it's extremely hard to actually make a comeback, unless your team can get the jump on the next point, or the next rotation on Domination. And if a medic or squadmate is nearby, players decide to bleed out when they were just about to revived, which has happened both to me and happened to many medics that I've given up on because I was convinced no one would revive me.

So if the timer is just a little slower, then this problem may be fixed.

Another issue is that at least with a couple maps, some of the objective spots were a little poorly thought out. The best example I can give is on Empire State KOTH, where the D hill is at that Gazebo spot. On that hill, almost no one can get time on it because the bounds of that hill are so wide that both teams are always constantly on it, and if one team does happen to take control, the other team virtually can't make any play to take control themselves because of the layout of the hill. Some objectives just need some adjusting, and while I can't give specific feedback on how to fix them, at the very least I can make it known that it's a bit of a frustrating issue.

Other than that, I don't really think I have much to say other than what everyone else is saying. Nerf movement a little bit, nerf shotgun, wipe with some elbow grease, and we should be good to go. I had a lot of fun with these game modes and I'm excited to potentially main BF6 for a good while.

Before playing this game, I've only seen it on steam or just the cover for it, and then I watch a video made by Tbag Gaming which showed gameplay that caught my interest. The gameplay looked pretty similar to battlefield and the beta for bf6 just ended recently so I thought I'd try out the game on PS5

It's day 2 of playing the game, so I tried out the operations mode and my first real warfare match after doing a practice with AI. And I just feel so confused overall. I see that there's a campaign story but I don't see where to play it? Is it through the operations? The Black Hawk Down mission? Or something else I'm not seeing? I watch these cutscenes with these characters and the villain being broken out of a prison, but nothing about a campaign story about them to play, at least not that I can see on the game.

The controls are a mess in my opinion, mainly the keybinds for gadgets, I have a lot of moments where I'm trying to use one thing and keep pulling out another. The menu navigation feels annoying, because I can't seem to back out completely and view every mode or option there is, but I'm instead forced to switch between them. The controls sometimes actually bug out and you can't do stuff on random menus including when trying to deploy in a match, or the cursor will just completely disable itself at random times.

Not sure how I feel about operators but they're okay I guess, at least this game seems to be made for them unlike 2042. Is this supposed to be mainly multiplayer where the story and context is just in cutscenes or something?

I really hope the game improves on console over time, because I don't want to drop it already. If anyone has any starting advice, I'd appreciate it.",False,/r/DeltaForceGlobal/comments/1mwuvfw/this_game_has_me_confused/,DeltaForceGlobal,1755830503.0,1,1.0,Discussion üó£Ô∏è

When capturing hard drives, do enemies get any information on where I am and what I'm doing?

Can multiple teams share one exfil?

What do I need to grab to call my squad back from death? (is it the unlink things?)

Are there only 2 chances to exfil?

What exactly is the point of capturing hard drives?

And lastly, the typical question that I am sure has been asked numerous times regarding this

Are the only people left playing it the people who only play this mode and do they purposely ignore drives just to hunt squads? Thats been my experience in the few matches I've had.

Hi,

I couldn't figure it out by myself, so here I am.

Recently, I upgraded to an RX 9070XT in order to enjoy BF6 as it is due, but for some reason, while trying to play 2042 for the free pass, I get this weird freezing every other 5 seconds.

What I've tried:  
\- Minimum or maximum settings are not related to the regularity of the freezes.  
\- Limiting FPS doesn't help either, I've tried game settings and RivaTunner fps limiter.  
\- Resolution doesn't help, I've tried 1080p and lower resolutions.  
\- I reinstalled the game, didn't help.  
\- I moved the game from one SSD to another, it is not that.

System Summary:  
\- Ryzen 7 5800X  
\- RX 9070XT  
\- 32 GB Ram at 3200MHz  
\- Windows 11 Pro 24H2

Additional notes:  
\- Whenever the game is not freezing, I get up to 270-300 frames, with an average of 230.  
\- All drivers are up to date.  
\- It only happens with this game.  
\- Computer OS was clean formatted a week ago to install windows 11.  
\- Between formatting date and new GPU installation, the issue didn't happen with my previous GPU (RTX 3070)  
\- I understand there is a GPU bottleneck happening in my system when playing at 1080p (new 2k monitor on the way yay!), but I believe this isn't enough to justify the random CPU usage I'm seeing while playing this game (jumping from 100% to 20% whenever the game freezes as seen in the video), since I've played heavier games such as Cyberpunk 2077 with full ray tracing at 60fps for hours.

Long time lurker, and finally a first time poster. Got my first rig about a year ago. Before you crucify me, I didn't know about the subreddit and kinda bought blindly after doing *some* research and what seemed like a good deal at the time. Got an MSI Aegis R9 (yeah, now I know...). 

It's got: 

MSI PRO B760 WiFi 7
i9 14900f 
MSI Ventus 2X OC 4070 
32GB Ram 

Ventilation is decent, not superb, with the GPU staying around 55-60c with both GPU fans and case fans blowing like an F35. To be fair I have not looked at CPU temps (away from home for a few days so can't really check either). 

Been looking into upgrading into a 5080, solely because the 4070 seems to be lagging behind, and it's not anywhere near max game settings. I'm usually on COD, will be on BF6 (the beta didn't really play great on my rig), Cities Skyline II, Fallout, Chornobyl, RDR2 etc. I try to dip into a bit of everything where and when I can. Also been trying to play Alan Wake 2, as I played the first one on console many years ago and have heard awesome things about it. 

Besides from a 5080, looking to upgrade:

-PSU as my PC came with a non modular 750w unit. Been looking at Corsair RMe RM1000e 80+ gold 
-Add Corsair iCue Link TITAN 240RX AIO, currently just air cooled 
-MSI RTX5080 16G GAMING TRIO OC to replace my 4070 

Now, my question to the PCMR is: is this worth my time upgrading these components, knowing the 14900f is not the ideal CPU for gaming? Would these components make a difference on my gaming experience? I might not be able to max out settings, I totally get that, but I'm hoping it delivers better and more consistent gameplay than the frame drops or the ghosting from frame gen (when on) on the 4070. 

You can totally tell me I'm delusional, and this crap will never behave the way I'm wanting it to. Just looking for smooth, 1440p gaming with low input lag and decent frame rates at a good visual setting. 

Bonus question: would an eBay sourced 4090 be a good choice? Non FE versions seem to range from $1600-$3400. I'm a little skittish buying something that expensive knowing I might get something totally different. 

Lastly, please feel free to chime in and recommend any further upgrades or different parts from what I've described above. 

Really appreciate y'all. Hoping to make this happen.

Part of what made the older Battlefields feel so good was that weapon choice was tied to class. You instantly knew what role someone was playing, and it forced teamwork, recons handled long range, medics supported with their kit, engineers dealt with vehicles, and assaults pushed the line.

In BF6‚Äôs beta, it feels like class choice doesn‚Äôt matter because you can just equip whatever gun you want. To me, that takes away from both immersion and balance.

On top of that, I‚Äôd love sniper glint to only mean ‚Äúrecon with a scope aimed at you.‚Äù Not a medic with a health bag camping a hill and a sniper rifle.

So, for example, if you don't like the inherent randomness of matchmaking, you could create a custom Portal server (that is persistent) and pick the map rotation you want, maybe increase the ticket count, disallow some weapons/gadgets if you'd like, etc. and call your server something memorable like ""Reggie's Awesome Server!!!"" (or ""! Turtles"" or ""! Flubber"" or ""! STONKS"" √† la some of the popular BF4 servers). If enough people like that configuration, more and more people will join it and you'd have that classic Battlefield community that way.

Maybe if you are a part of a community on Discord or something you can have links/codes to your Portal servers so everyone in your community plays on the same server(s). That's not to mention the mountains of improvements and additional customization they added to BF6's Portal compared to 2042.

This way, they get to keep matchmaking for the majority of players who don't care about the ""community"" aspect of a persistent server and just want to play the fucking game. Plus you can still select a gamemode and/or map using custom search, which I expect to be improved even more before launch.

It also means that you don't have this ridiculous, endless list of ""[DICE] Conquest US East #21144"" that you have to wade through to find a map/gamemode you want to play. I remember that being a really, really annoying thing about past Battlefield games.

Another thing I'm confused about is the whole ""official"" server thing. The devs have said that they'd have ""verified"" servers that, if a server is customized within reason (i.e. true to a normal Battlefield experience), you can receive full XP as if it were an ""official"" server. Isn't that the same effect as actual official servers?

Also, with respect to the criticism of, ""well, Portal is a hidden feature and not the main menu so nobody will use it,"" then maybe they can advertise popular Portal servers on the home page in addition to the normal matchmaking servers? It could be a section like, ""Your friends [on EA Connect] frequently play these Portal servers"" or something similar. Remember to fill out the Open Beta survey with your suggestions because I know I will!

I know this subreddit can get... heated, but I genuinely want to know why this isn't literally a perfect solution. Is it just a lack of trust that they will deliver?

P.S. I've played this franchise since about 2012 starting with BF3 so I am a true ""BaTtLeFieLd vEtERaN"" or whatever.

i personally loved it, i primarily played support and engineer, having ammo/medic bag in one, made me feel really important to all infantry when pushing, keeping everyone revived, full health/ammo, and obscured in smoke as they pushed, and i grew really attached to the LMG because i could be a jack of all trades, CQB decent, Midrange Great, Long range Solid. especially for suppressing snipers, keeping their eyes on me not my team even if i could not kill them.

but this also translated to Engineer, having an LMG as engineer felt right, being behind a tank means very often being at the forefront of the battle and having an LMG to suppress and have enough ammo in one mag to take out 3-4 enemies that are on an objective really helps. i also took out a few Heli pilots when they paused for an missile volley.

  
one aspect i love about battlefield is that you cannot be ready for every situation, and many situations are unfair, but there is always a counter. of course there should be balance, but having open weapons feels right IMHO, if someone is abusing the shotgun, bring longer ranged weapons or explosives, or take a shotgun and give them a taste of their medicine. likewise with a crackshot enemy sniper, bring or communicate to a tank to send some HE his way, or countersniper, or in my case suppress with 100 rnds of lead.

but i have not heard any serious argument for why Closed weapons is better than Open weapons, other than its new/ harder to balance. and i would really like to understand that opinion.

1mwom82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwom82/a_little_bf_history_to_bring_the_current_movement/,,6,A little BF history to bring the current movement discussion into perspective.,dontdxmebro,False,True,False,,False,"Alright, let's talk about something. I'm an old. I'm 33. I've been playing BF since 1942 and really got into it with BF2. In that time I've done everything from the vaunted 8v8 competitive infantry leagues in BF2, the much much larger vehicle maps with 64 players and then continuing all the way until BFV. My favorites being probably BF4, BF1 and BF2.

Movement has basically always been a contentious issue in this game and I find generally all sides of the current argument just a massive circlejerk when you put the history of this discussion into perspective.

**Battlefield 2**

To start, do any of you remember the BF2 Demo? The meta the game shipped with? My god it was a movement fiasco. You were able to spam prone, movement speed was high, and jumping distance put Olympians to shame. This was deemed ""dolphin diving."" Not only this - but you could throw C4 like Cal Ripken, so this led to one of the craziest metas I've ever experienced: the dolphin diving + C4 chucking meta. Completely absurd, kind of fun in a weird way - but so far beyond what we're dealing with right now.

Dolphin diving continued to be a topic of debate in the community for the entirety of BF2's existence even as they nerfed movement and the C4 tossing distance. It was in some respects¬†*much*¬†harder to counter then the recent discussions around CoD movement depending on the situation. You could do this strafe to the side, jump, insta prone thing that you definitely can't do in any modern BF. Eventually it was tamed down quite a bit but still there was a divide between the jumpy prone spam people and the people who think playing Battlefield is like a 1:1 real life simulator.

Some of the maps people look back upon like 64 player Karkand? Complete joke. You have not seen nade spam unless you played Infantry Only Karkand in 2006. A rain of powerful grenades that made Metro look tame.

In some respects BF2 is still my favorite Battlefield. The map design was my favorite. Air power had a high skill ceiling but if you were good you were dominant. Tanks and vehicles movement felt great and they felt scary to come up against but not OP, however I do believe a lot of this is nostalgia. I haven't played in ages but usually when I go back to games this old it feels way worse then I remember it feeling and it lacks a lot of modern QOL features.

**Battlefield Bad Company 2**

Everyone loves BC2 now, but back then it was a source of controversy that seems very familiar... lots of claims about smaller maps ruining what makes Battlefield great and venerating the vaunted ""Big Maps with Vehicles."" The graphics, style and hitmarkers were all signs of the CoD-ification of battlefield. Rush mode was instant gratification trash against the purity and tactical supremacy of Conquest. The series would never be the same.

In reality, I had tons of fucking fun with BC2. It was different then BF2 and slightly dumbed down, but generally more unserious. The map design and smaller player count was a big downside though, but destruction was cool.

**Battlefield 3-4**

Clumping these together because they're pretty similar. The same discussion remained. Battlefield maps were smaller then they used to be and they're just trying to piggyback on Call of Duty. People complained about bunnyhoppers and shotgun users and AEK sweats and the world went on. Battlefield 4 had the worst launch of any Battlefield but they managed to turn it into one of the best Battlefields even if it took 2-3 years. It had bigger BF2 style maps, it had good gunplay, it had some attempts at doing something new, and movement was in a decent spot.

**Battlefield 1**

It got interesting with BF1 because the movement was even more nerfed then before. You could slide but bunny hopping was gone, prone spam was useless and it seemed like it had the movement all the complainers finally wanted but was seen as dumbed down by many. The introduction of random spread to automatic weapons and other penalties led to claims of them dumbing down the series and making it more RNG friendly.

Personally, I love BF1. You could still movement your way out of dying but the really absurd stuff was taken out. Loved the infantry bolt action rifles actually being quite powerful and fun to use. Didn't mind the sweet spot mechanic so much and the weapon balance is one of the best in the whole series other then the random spread mechanics, but it was unique because of its setting.

**Battlefield 5**

Battlefield 5 actually didn't contribute that much to the movement discussion. It's problems remained in the EA community support, the weird cultural shit happening with people whining about there being women and black people in the game and things like not including any of the famous battles of the war on launch. Lots of very strange design decisions - but in the end the gunplay and map design were actually very good. The gunplay and movement especially are top tier, which is one of the reason BFV was so disappointing to me. It was a very fun game somewhat ruined by poor decisions at the top. I stopped playing after this and I'm glad I skipped 2042.

**In Conclusion:**

Not only am I writing this shitty novel because I have an hour to kill at a coffee shop until a meeting, I'm here to say - the discussion on movement is not something new. The ""Call of Duty-ificiation"" you all speak of has literally been the same shit since BC2 came out in¬†**two thousand fucking ten**. 15 years ago. Movement has ALWAYS been split between the sweats and the milsim guys. It has always been like this. It may be more pronounced now because select sweats have made careers out of being sweaty with people watching and social media becoming more prolific but there is nothing more consistent then half the community whining about this debate. BF6 is in my opinion, a pretty good spot for a release and I didn't find it to be too sweaty if I'm real. It more just had a low TTK and the map design in some cases is just... bad.

I'm not saying anyone is correct either. While I will always be a bit of a sweat in spirit, I understand there needs to be a happy medium. The Warzone movement shit is pretty whack, so I'm glad they're nerfing movement a bit. Go play Apex if that kind of game is what you want. Warzone will always be a deadbeat dad, abusive boyfriend game and/or a screechy child's toy. Don't play Warzone.

When it comes to the milsim dudes, why are you here? Go play Squad. Squad and games like Arma Reforger are right there, just for you - and they have far more access to vibrant and dedicated communities then we did back in the Project Reality days. You might even be able to get some kills with your sloth reaction times and old man ass attitude about gaming.

At what point do you consider repasting and replacing thermal pads?

Hotspot temp hits 105 degrees while playing the BF6 beta, 3080 fans sound crazy. I bought the card second hand year or two ago‚Ä¶ normally play much less demanding games on the odd chance I get to game. 

Done a little research on replacing the thermal pads, is there no better way than trial and error to figure out what thickness pads you need?

Is the change meant to address that?

I really enjoyed how player movement felt in the game during the beta, and I personally never did this weird spamming motion or saw anybody else doing it. While im sure there were plenty, and there would be more as time went on, I‚Äôm just concerned that they may clubfoot the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù movement as well. Hopefully this fix addresses the abuse, but doesn‚Äôt hamper typical player movement. 

I love the grounded nature of this new iteration in the franchise, but I wouldn‚Äôt want it to go so far as to feel like a MILSIM game with sluggish movement.

I‚Äôve got a 5700x3d 32gb 3200mhz and a 9070xt

Before the update I got stutters every so often (only on this game not on any others ) 

Bf6 ran 140fps no problem with no frame gen 

Why does this game use 100% of my cpu all the time now , I can‚Äôt play won‚Äôt multiple seconds worth of input lag when it randomly stutters , happens on lowest graphics settings or on highest tried with a bunch of different settings and different resolutions (I currently play on 5120x1440p)

When I first saw people up there, I thought ""look at those losers"". Then I thought why not try it before it gets fixed.

Once I got up there I landed a few unfair kills and yes it did feel kinda gross lol... until I got sniped halfway across the map from what appears to be another out of bounds spot at the other spawn.

Don't you think it would've been cool if they actually integrated the rooftops into the map? Clean up all the out of bounds save for 2 and create more detailed assets for those spots that blend well with the rest of the map AND make them destructible (or at least the way leading to them) so that there is only limited opportunity to take advantage of the height advantage. One on either side of the map, one for each team, and maybe only accessible at points B and E so that attacking points A and F isn't a total nightmare, but keep the challenge of actually getting up there in place somehow so that there is some downside to make the snipers master their movement a bit more you know.

I mean Battlefield was always about fighting the opposition on different levels right. Infantry and their respective classes, light vehicles, heavy vehicles, tanks, anti-air, jets, and helos.

I just think it would be pretty cool if another level was added to the mix for the snipers (I think they'd get less hate lol) where they can battle it out... implemented as described above.

**Jets** need to have better flight controls (Please Look at War Thunders flying controls as an example. NOTE: I'm not asking for War Thunders damage system).

**Helicopters** need to have there BF4 movement return & the Anti-Air needs to be nerfed because having Anti-Air guns at Objectives, Anti-Air Tanks, Anti-Air at HQ Spawns & Anti-Air Personal Missiles (Stingers) is just to much for Helicopters to deal with right now.

**Tanks** need to be made stronger but in return repairing shouldn't be as strong as it currently is. With the current system the Tanks feel terrible when you are by yourself operating them but if you have a few people repairing your tank you will become a nearly unstoppable force which isn't super fun to fight against. (Even if its Epic).

***Weapons:***

**DMR's** need rebalanced they felt terrible to use & almost no one I played with used them & almost no one I went against was using them.

The **Shotgun** needs nerfed (I know this is gonna happen but I just wanted to make the point here).

**Snipers** need to have there sweet spot mechanic removed, Its not fun at all to die to someone & not be able to get revived just because they camped themselves at the perfect distance.

***Systems:***

**Bloom** on ALL forms of weapons NEEDS to be removed!!! Dying because my bullets didn't go where I aimed is one of the worst feelings in this game right now & it NEEDS to go. Bloom is one of the biggest reasons as to why I stopped playing BF1.

Certain maps need to have there **Spawns** worked on for objectives the biggest example I can give on this is the C objective on Empire State currently the spawn system just spawns you into the open which is not acceptable.

**Reviving** needs some improvements, Right now reviving by dragging people feels great but reviving with Defibrillators feels off & not natural.

The **Scoreboard** needs some improvements, This will sound ironic but BF2042 currently has a better Scoreboard that BF6.

A j√°t√©k futtat√°s√°hoz ugyanis UEFI + Secure Boot volt az aj√°nlott (s≈ët, sok esetben k√∂telez≈ë) rendszerfelt√©tel, ami rengeteg g√©pen nem volt alapb√≥l aktiv√°lva - vagy √©pp nem is volt el√©rhet≈ë.

# Technikai h√°tt√©r ‚Äì mi is az a Secure Boot √©s UEFI?

* **Secure Boot**: egy biztons√°gi protokoll, ami csak megb√≠zhat√≥ oper√°ci√≥s rendszert enged elindulni. Ez seg√≠t megakad√°lyozni a rootkit-eket √©s egy√©b t√°mad√°sokat.
* **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: a modern BIOS, ami gyorsabb bootol√°st, jobb biztons√°got √©s t√∂bb funkci√≥t k√≠n√°l. De teljes √°talakul√°st kell elv√©gezni BIOS-on bel√ºl, ha ebbe belementek.
* **Legacy BIOS + MBR**: a r√©gi rendszer, amit sok j√°t√©kos m√©g mindig haszn√°l, f≈ëleg r√©gebbi g√©peken.

A gond? A Secure Boot **csak UEFI GPT-m√≥dban m≈±k√∂dik**, √©s ha valaki Legacy BIOS-ban van, akkor **√°t kell konvert√°lni a rendszer√©t GPT-re**, ami m√°r nem egy kattint√°s - hanem egy potenci√°lisan adatveszt√©ssel j√°r√≥ m≈±velet

Steam statisztik√°k - h√°ny j√°t√©kost √©rint ez?

A Steam Hardware Survey alapj√°n:

* **UEFI-t haszn√°l√≥ g√©pek ar√°nya**: nem k√∂zvetlen√ºl m√©rik, de az adatokb√≥l √©s a Windows 11 kompatibilit√°si statisztik√°kb√≥l becs√ºlhet≈ë, hogy **kb. 80‚Äì85%** m√°r modern UEFI rendszeren fut. Teh√°t a gamerek T√ñBBS√âGE m√°r modern configra v√°ltott
* **MBR part√≠ci√≥val rendelkez≈ë g√©pek**: becsl√©sek szerint **10‚Äì15%** lehet, f≈ëleg r√©gebbi g√©peken - Ennek legal√°bb 5-6% v√°lthat √°t UEFI-re a BF6 megjelen√©s miatt
* **Secure Boot akt√≠v g√©pek**: szint√©n nem k√∂zvetlen√ºl m√©rik, de a Windows 11 k√∂vetelm√©nyek miatt **kb. 70‚Äì75%** m√°r aktiv√°lta vagy enged√©lyezte.

Ez alapj√°n **kb. 10‚Äì15%** lehet az a j√°t√©kosr√©teg, akik **technikai okokb√≥l nem tudt√°k elind√≠tani a BF6 b√©t√°t**, vagy nem mert√©k el≈ërendelni, mert nem akartak beleny√∫lni a BIOS-ba.

‚ÄûEz az els≈ë j√°t√©k, ami miatt a BIOS-hoz kellett ny√∫lnom. Ez nem norm√°lis.‚Äù 

‚ÄûUninstall, √©s felejts√ºk el. Nem fogom kock√°ztatni a g√©pem egy j√°t√©k miatt.‚Äù 

‚ÄûSecure Boot? M√©g a nev√©t se hallottam, am√≠g a BF6 el nem j√∂tt.‚Äù

A Steam f√≥rumokon √©s Redditen is rengeteg panasz √©rkezett, f≈ëleg azokra a g√©pekre, ahol **nincs TPM**, vagy **a BIOS nem t√°mogatja az UEFI-t**. Ez k√ºl√∂n√∂sen f√°j√≥ volt azoknak, akik **r√©gi, de m√©g er≈ës g√©peken** j√°tszanak.

A Battlefield 6 nem csak a j√°t√©kmenet√©vel, hanem a technikai k√∂vetelm√©nyeivel is megosztotta a Battlefield PC-s rajong√≥i k√∂z√∂ss√©get. B√°r a Secure Boot √©s UEFI val√≥ban biztons√°gosabb √©s modernebb, a PC gaming szabads√°g√°nak r√©sze az is, hogy ne kelljen BIOS-t buher√°lni egy j√°t√©k miatt. √âs ez jogos.

I love Battlefield and I don't really like Call of Duty as a series ‚Äì in general, I'm a big fan of the concept of the first franchise and I have almost nothing in common with the second, no nostalgic feelings. I played BF2 (as a kid and it made a huge impression on me back then), BF3 (like 10 hours) and **hundreds** of hours in BF4, BF1 and BFV. My favorite part is Battlefield 1, it's a PEAK. I don't like 2042 (especially the maps, lack of atmosphere and scale), but I really liked the beta of the fresh BF6 ‚Äì movement, gunplay, destruction, sounds, atmosphere. All this is one big mix of the best developments of DICE. I even liked the ""small"" maps, because I love maps like Amiens, Provence, Flood Zone and even Operation Metro. Infantry maps, which are as much a part of Battlefield as the big ones, vehicle maps like Golmud Railway and Caspian Border ‚Äì whether you agree with it or not. It's classic Battlefield.

Everyone has their own opinion, but a certain, really loud group of people seems to think that their opinion of the game is exclusive. As if the entire community loves the same things in this series as they do, and everyone else is a pity outsiders, a group of outcasts and defectors from a completely different FPS series. It's infuriating. But the funniest thing is that it has always been like this. 

Under the BF3 vs BF4 comparison videos from 10+ years ago, you can find people who seriously say that after BF2, the series got worse and moved away from its roots. But for most people here now, these subsequent parts of the series are what define Battlefield for them! Do you realize how bipolar and toxic a community we are that we shit on each other's interests on a regular basis? Why is it so hard to like all games? Even 2042 deserves some love... at least for now, after all these patches. I'm playing this right now to get exclusive rewards in BF6 and I think.. there are good things in it that could have worked better and yet I don't judge or call names on those who truly love the game. I respect their opinions. It's Battlefield too, even if I don't like it.

Speaking specifically about the changes after the beta... I don't know what to think, guys. For a fan of BF3 and BF4, this is probably incredibly happy news. The movement will be slower, yay! Even though according to tests BF6 has the slowest running in the history of the series, lol. You like it, but I personally don't want to go back to 2011-2014. I love BF4, it's a great game, but I don't want a brand new game that made a very good impression on me to turn into something that people can't let go of and hold on to with claws and fangs. ""COD sweats"".. I could also label all men over 35-40 who are unhappy with the new game as infantile, scruffy old gamers with rose-colored nostalgic glasses, but I don‚Äôt do that. 

I'm not a COD fan (BF has so much more potential than COD that EA, sadly, never tried to exploit), but I really liked the open beta movement. Actually, it was a really good balance between the DNA of Battlefield games and something new, modern. It's not a crazy, twitchy COD omni-movement ‚Äì it's something much more enjoyable!

And I really hope that these new changes don't make the great game worse and in the end we all get something that brings us pleasure.

Peace ‚ô•Ô∏è

Meaning, if you only equip RPG - you get 6 rockets, but if you equip RPG + Stinger - you get 3 rockets for each. Other gadgets are not affected, only if you equip two launchers.

With closed weapons as the focus currently the lmg and reviving role of the support clash as the lmg is a more stationary weapon and reviving requires a more mobile playstyle.  removing revives all together from the support when unequipping the defibs would allow players to build the support more like how it was in bf3/4/1 focusing on resupplies, supressive fire, and defensive gadgets as well as making it so they don't appear on downed players as someone who can pick them up.

As bf6 is already leaning into the subclasses you can have the combat medic support  running carbines defibs and smoke launcher or the supressive fire support running the lmg wall and anti gernade Sentinel.

The better solution would probably be to make a 5th dedicated class for medic with smgs as the main but I thought this could be another route they could take.

If you're playing on Xbox Series X|S, I highly recommend you play the old-gen Xbox One version. The reason is that the Xbox One version has cross-play only between console versions (Xbox and PS4), with no PC players. However, the next-gen version of BF2042 has cross-play between consoles *and* PC, which makes the game unbalanced and unfair.

This is because playing against players using a mouse and keyboard is inherently unfair; their reaction time and gameplay are significantly faster than that of controller players. This makes the game feel unjust on a controller. But when you play only against other console players on controllers, the gameplay and pace are absolutely perfect.

We play on consoles to use controllers and play against other controller players, not to play against PC players with their lightning-fast reaction times.

And yes, simply turning off cross-play in the next-gen version doesn't help‚Äîyou'll just get thrown into empty lobbies because there aren't enough people. So, I highly recommend that if you play 2042, you play the Xbox One version.

I started the BF series with BF1, then BFV and BF2042. One thing I always regretted in 2042 compared to BFV was the sound of the guns, and maybe the overall feeling of shooting with guns.  

Now I wonder if it's just me, or if this is shared and known by the community : I feel like I shoot some fake bullets in 2042. The sound is flat, guns do not have recoil.

In BFV, the kick and the sound design of guns made the gunplay feel concrete, heavy, I felt the power of the guns. I want to know if it's just the fact that I like the settings of BFV more (WW2) or my audio settings are not properly configured or what. 

I ask this now because I felt like BF6 was close to 2042 in that aspect

I upgraded to a 34"" monitor earlier this year with 3440x1440 resolution and up to 165hz freq. So it'll be nice to be able to utilize the size and the frequency.  My current laptop only output 60Hz.

Does anyone has experience with steamdeck, ROG ally or the likes hooked up to external monitor, mouse and keyboards? Can you play games in high resolution and frequency?

I'm guessing I would still need GeForce Now.

I don't play console games , so there is a chance that the handheld will be permanently docked to my monitor station..

and the thing is this is exactly how battlefield has stuffed it up before like bf4 was a buggy mess at launch and then bf2042 was basically unplayable for ages and both of those games only really came good later on after patches and updates but by then the hype and player base had already dropped heaps so i‚Äôm just worried the same thing might happen again cause it feels like they‚Äôre repeating history

dont get me wrong the game feels and looks great feels exactly how it use too and i‚Äôm hyped as hell for it but if they rush it and it comes out broken or half baked then that hype‚Äôs gonna disappear real quick and cod will take advantage of that even if bo7 ends up being average people will still switch cause they dont wanna deal with another dodgy battlefield launch

like battlefield has the chance to really take over this year and put cod in the dirt for once but they gotta actually deliver at launch otherwise it‚Äôs just gonna be another cycle of waiting months for fixes and by then the moment‚Äôs already gone

The recent reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at Gamescom was met with mixed reactions from fans, as many are feeling burned out by the franchise's annual releases and are instead hyped for EA‚Äôs Battlefield 6. The hype surrounding BF6's open beta has been immense, with players praising its gritty combat, boots-on-the-ground action, sharp visuals, squad gameplay, and snappy shooting. This has led to comparisons between the two franchises, with some even suggesting that Battlefield 6 will ""boot stomp"" Call of Duty this year.

  
The historical context here is significant as it marks a shift in player preferences when it comes to military shooters. For years, Call of Duty dominated the market with its fast-paced action and futuristic settings. However, recent entries have seen mixed reception from fans who long for the more realistic, grounded gameplay of earlier titles like Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare. The success of BF6's beta suggests that there is a demand for this style of gameplay once again.

  
The potential implications are vast, as they could lead to changes in how both franchises approach their future games. If Call of Duty wants to regain its position at the top of the military shooter genre, it may need to rethink its formula and return to a more realistic style similar to what made Black Ops 1 so popular back in 2010. On the other hand, Battlefield 6 could capitalize on this momentum by continuing to refine its gameplay mechanics and deliver an experience that sets itself apart from competitors like Call of Duty and Halo Infinite.

  
As a longtime fan of both franchises, I find this development fascinating. While I enjoyed the reveal trailer for Black Ops 7 at Gamescom, I can't help but feel excited about what Battlefield 6 has to offer. The gritty realism and tactical gameplay of BF6 resonate with me more than the over-the-top action found in many modern Call of Duty titles. If anything, this shift in player preferences serves as a reminder that innovation is key in maintaining relevance within the gaming industry ‚Äì something both franchises would do well to remember moving forward.

It feels like input lag or stutter that affects **mouse movement**. The mouse cursor itself is fine outside the game, and other games don‚Äôt have this issue.

# ‚úÖ What I‚Äôve tried so far:

* Updated GPU drivers
* Turned off raw mouse input / Windows pointer precision
* Disabled fullscreen optimizations
* Disabled Future Frame Rendering
* Disabled Turbo Boost (drops temps but issue remains)
* Disabled E-cores in BIOS (i5-14400F)
* Changed mouse polling rate (1000 ‚Üí 500 ‚Üí 250 ‚Üí 125 Hz)
* Tried a different wired mouse
* Verified game files
* Killed all background apps/overlays (Discord, GeForce Experience, Steam/EA overlay)
* Lowered all CPU-heavy settings (mesh, lighting, terrain, post-processing)
* Tried both DX11 & DX12
* Lowest graphics possible ‚Üí still stuttering
* Capped FPS in-game and with RTSS
* Increased pagefile size
* Tried different servers to rule out network

# üß† Findings:

* Temps with Turbo on are very high (97‚Äì100¬∞C), but turning it off and lowering temps doesn‚Äôt fix stutter.
* VRAM usage is \~4‚Äì4.5 GB / 6 GB on high settings, still stutters even on lowest textures.
* Frametimes in RTSS are never flat ‚Äî always spiky even when FPS is stable.
* Stutter is ONLY in this game ‚Äî other games run fine (Even BF6 ran smoothly on a 100-120 fps)
* Mouse input stutter feels worse during movement/turning, almost like input gets delayed then snaps ahead.

# Specs:

* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060
* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-14400F
* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING Z790-PLUS WIFI DDR5
* **RAM:** 32GB DDR5 (2x16GB) 6000MHz CL30
* **OS:** Windows 11

At this point, I‚Äôm not sure if this is just BF2042 being CPU-heavy/poorly optimized or if something‚Äôs wrong on my end.

Given the current lull in game releases, the last 10 days in August, the first 10 days in September..

If I am Team Cherry, I am just sending it bro. I think it would be insane PR to make an announcement, everyone is expecting a release date, and they just say ""lol go play it now""

Silksong has been delayed so long that giving a date with another waiting period, considering the above, makes way less sense to me than making a huge wave full releasing the game after years and years of silence. I'm so far gone I can't tell if I'm in total copium overdose.

Always been a cod fan. Really just an FPS fan. I played BF3 and always like the metro map where I would see clips of 1 lmg and about 25 people spawning behind the stairs and escalators. Only reason I couldn't get into it was because when I was younger I wanted to snipe but my controller had trigger stops and I couldn't squeeze the trigger all the way down to snipe. Does that sound accurate for snipers?

All this to ask what progression system does Battlefield have. I dont care if there's not a ""CaMo GrInD"" or ""Master Prestige lvl 1000"". I watched the bo7 relesse and I'm for once going to wait on it. But BF6 looked like fun. I didn't play the beta but watched a lot of Scump, Shroud, TimTheFatMan, and Dr. Disrespect. 

As someone who's never played BF and would love to get into it what can I expect to do within the game? Except potentially find 1 map I like and only play that map. I want to get out of this COD brain of mine and play something different. Go easy on me.

Just loaded into BF2042 and forgot how bad the UI looks. The HUD and all UI elements including all ingame menus dont scale with resolution, resulting in a low resolution fuzzy HUD. Battlefield 6 beta did not have a scaling UI as well, which means its the 9th year the UI and HUD of Battlefield games will look blurry and have a low resolution on a lot of screens and every single display with a 3840x2160 resolution. It began with Battlefield 1, continued with Battlefield V and 2042 and apparently BF6 will have this issue as well. It apparently is inherent to the the game's UI scaling and there is no fix as of today. EA does not reply to tickets and most players swallow or dont care. It is incredibly lazy, cheapens the whole feel of the game and is an eye sore - it really is awful to look at and really off-putting. Is there ever going to be a fix?

How nice would it be to have a message on the deployment page that states how many Engineers, Assault, Scouts and Supports are in the team?

Or even like the game itself tells you your team needs 3 more supports and two engineers.

I would really like a mechanic like that because I often find myself in games where I notice that maybe the enemies have too many vehicles and there are too few engineers, maybe there are few scouts and there is no good spotting, maybe there are only 2 doctors and we waste tickets for nothing, or our team doesn't push because no one uses close quarters weapons.

To encourage balancing the team there could also be a reward of 200/300 points if you choose the recommended class.

I had to force myself into playing a second game after the first one in 2042. That game has such a bad sense of physicality, nothing seems to have weight in there. Weapons feel like they're made of cardboard, both when you move around and when you shoot. Landed shots have no rewarding feeling, everything feels just flat and uninteresting. Even the graphics feel just generic. 

I had some complaints about BF6 after the beta, but after trying 2042 I take all those complaints back, BF6 is just a far superior shooter and I'm so happy they took this much needed turn for the franchise. 

Anyway, I downloaded 2042 mainly for the classic experiences on Portal (specifically BF3 and BC2) but I can't find any games for those, just bot farming servers.

One says buy the 9700x the other says buy 9800x3d. If I buy the 9800x3d it will be overkill? But what if I upgrade gpu over some years to like 5080/5090 whes prices are good. Is it still worth it? Or just save money en go 9700x and use it for 5 years?
Also Im watching to save on motherbord and maybe get the ASUS TUF Gaming B650-PLUS WIFI but i need to bios update for 9800x3d. What are the thougts here?
