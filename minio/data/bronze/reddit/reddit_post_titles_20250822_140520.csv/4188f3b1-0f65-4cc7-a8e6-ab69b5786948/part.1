BF2042 isn't terrible when I started playing it as it is, rather than thinking about what it isn't.

The Iwo Jima map is insanely good. I have never been a huge vehicle user, so the idea of a map with little building coverage never really interested me, but the immersion that vehicles bring is amazing. I started tank hunting and man is that satisfying when you C4 one, or get the last hit with a rocket launcher. Helicopters flying overhead, crashing, the jets swooping low, the whole thing is very good.

With that being said: The BF6 Beta

I really enjoyed the beta, I love the close quarters combat that we got from it, Cairo was my favorite map and the only one that really had like a ""modern"" taste to it. I've played Squad and there's something cool about running around Fallujah-ish type maps. 

I'm ok with smaller maps - but I now do think it needs more vehicles and to be a bit larger + bigger lobbies.

Visually speaking - as a ground soldier, witnessing helicopters flying overhead, crashing into those tall buildings, the destruction. Running out from a small alley with a tank or two patrolling the streets puts you in situations you don't otherwise get in any other game. **This is what it was missing.**

I think stat-worrying has put a stumbling block in the minds of gamers. People who want a good KD and not die constantly to someone who is very efficient in flying a helicopter, or a tank around every corner, are missing out on the situational challenge that BF games produces. Games are supposed to be FUN. I know that term is different for everyone, but to me the more insane challenges I come across the better.

If I need to get to Objective A and there are two tanks patrolling the streets and I somehow need to get past them, that brings an aspect of situational strategy that is fun. If I die, ok? I'll respawn and try again. I'll do something different, maybe now instead of trying to get by I'll try to blow them up.

On another note - I think class system needs to be locked 100%. I don't think I need to elaborate more on that.

Idk just my thoughts. I want immersion, action movie scenarios, and to just have fun",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx72ni/a_battlefield_vet_take_on_bf2042_and_bf6/,Battlefield,1755870622.0,0,0.25,Battlefield 6

I'm on the path of building my 3rd custom pc build. I'd like the community advice on my component choices.

I'm aiming for a premium build mostly intended for gaming at 1440p 165hz on modern titles (bf6,gta6). I'd like this build to last at least 5 to 7 years. 

AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D;
Asus ROG Strix B650E-E;
Corsair vengeance RGB 2x32GB 6000MHz DDR5;
Asus TUF RTX 5080 Gaming OC;
Corsaire ICUE Link TITAN 360 RX RGB;
Samsung 990 Pro M.2 2TB;
Corsair RM1000x Shift 80 plus Gold;

I haven't choose a case yet. I'm esitating between Corsair ICUE 5000X/D RGB or a Frame 5000D RS RGB

I might also wait for the 5080 Super to come out.

What do you think ?

1mx69el,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mx69el/hot_take_only_recons_should_be_able_to_spot/,,0,HOT TAKE: Only Recons Should Be Able To Spot,CenturionB2,1755869348.0,True,False,,False,"# 1) Feels Bad, Man

You ever get the feeling when you were playing the BF6 beta that you were just glancing between looking at your screen for red diamonds and then at your mini map for more red diamonds instead of actually interacting with the environment? Like the beautifully designed and immersively rendered maps were just a pretty backdrop for an abstracted game of Space Invaders with you moving your yellow dot around a load red, blue and green dots? Did you ever feel like you couldn't break cover or try to flank because the second you did you'd appear as a bright red diamond on the screens of 20 enemy players saying ""Hey! Shoot me!""? Did all this leave you feeling tense, fatigued and unsatisfied with the game? Despite it being an overall great experience there was just something... off. I think I may have part of the reason why. And if you'll stick with me, also a potential solution.

# 2) The Problem

I'm of the opinion that the ubiquity and ease of the team spotting and auto-spotting mechanics detract from the potentially rich, immertive and engrossing design of not just BF6 but almost all modern BF games. I'd go further and say that the games need \*waaaaaay\* less intrusive HUD in general but that's a whole extra convo.

In addition to this, for years (decades) now we've all been aware of how the Recon/Scout class seems like the odd one out. It doesn't really fit neatly into the integrated teamwork jigsaw that Dice aims to create. They don't really have anything unique to contribute to the team effort.

In BF6: Assaults are front-line powerhouses, far more capable of breaking enemy lines than the other classes; Engineers are extremely capable at keeping friendly vehicles in the fight and are by far the best class for taking down heavily armoured enemy vehicles when dismounted; Only Supports are capable of healing and resupplying entire choke points and supporting infantry breakthroughs with rapid revives. Recons..? Well they can auto-spot but that's only marginally better than spamming Q, which everyone can do. The respawn beacon is useful but again it's just a slight extension of squad or vehicle respawning. Long range kills are great but it's probably easier and more efficient to pick assault and get up close and personal if you just want to get kills. The only thing they're reliably useful for is countering other Recons.

# 3) Recon Resentment

This design leads directly to the widespread feeling among players that Recons don't really contribute to the team effort and are just out for their own selfish aggrandisement getting 500 metre snipes from across the map sitting just in front of their own spawn beacon that's literally miles from any objective.

# 4) The Solution

Hence I propose that \*ONLY\* the Recon class should be able to Spot and that they should be given a big points incentive to do so, say 25 or even 50 points per spot and another 100 if that spot leads to a kill by a team mate with the usual +25% bonus for a squad assist (or something like that). This would shift the points incentive for Recons away from long distance kills and to.. you know... ACTUAL RECONNAISSANCE!

Just like in real life: Intelligence, Survailance and Reconnaissance are absolutely vital components of winning firefights, battles, operations and wars. A lack of good intelligence can stop whole offensives in their tracks. Or if they do go ahead, poor intel can lead to unmitigated disaster. Because of this front line reconnaissance units are often extremely highly respected among the ranks. The contribution they make to the team effort is invaluable and essential to the success rest of the force.

Back to Battlefield. A good Recon, unseen and off to the side, overseeing an objective, chokepoint or key area, pointing out unseen enemies, approaching vehicles and well laid traps \*as well as\* taking out well concealed and protected enemies should be able to make the difference between a successful push and a failed meatgrinder.

AND they should be rewarded for doing this! I played whole games in the beta being an absolutely manic Recon, using all the tools, gadgets and abilities to their absolute maximum as they were intended, supporting my team and squad as best i could. Hundreds of spots, dozens of beacon spawns in key areas, sensors picking up enemies behind key choke points, taking out enemies and vehicles with C4 as well counter sniping and picking off unsuspecting enemies. What did I get for all this? Bottom third of the leaderboard with just under 4,000 points.

# 5) Mitigating Side Effects

Now, there is the problem of enemy players being difficult to spot among the chaos and rubble especially with everyone being kitted out in modern, and very effective, camo which I think is why Dice have added the self-only auto-spot whenever you aim near enemies. This, in my opinion, is a bandaid solution and one that should only be temporary. There are many ways to solve this problem. I'm not a professional UI designer or Art Director but a solution could be as follows. A subtle, non-immersion breaking version of  the coloured ""outline"", ""glow"" or ""film"" you see around enemy players in other FOS games like Halo Infinate. I'm not suggesting that Dice make every enemy glow bright red but what I am suggesting is that they use something like this to make enemy silhouettes more distinct from the background colour pallette. And thus slightly more visible to players on the enemy team. Got a desert map where the character models are wearing tan or multicam? Add a subtle semi-transparent mid-brown and/or olive green overlay to the player's character model when seen by enemies. Got a dense forrest map? Add a light-green or tan overlay to the enemy character models. This would make enemies slightly easier to see while maintaining immersion and still making the players pay attention to and interact with with actual environment rather than just looking for red dots. Then when a Recon does spot an enemy and add that red dot above their heads: it's a godsend, and you're greatful to the Recon on your team/squad who helped you out. In addition to the previous points, this could be augmented to act as an extra bonus for Recon players with their stand-out colour overlay being less prominent than. non-Recon players. Like instead of the overlay being at 50% opacity for other players it's only 30% for the Recon class, adding to the stealthy mystique which their real-life counterparts gain.

# 6) Bringing It All Together

In conclusion: I think this change would complete the teamwork jigsaw that Dice is trying to create with the class system. Perhaps controversially, I really like what they've done with the Assault, Engineer and Support classes. Each class has a distinct, important and unique part of the puzzle but no one class can achieve victory alone. Only when all 4 classes come together and put their pieces of the puzzle together does your team start to fire on all cylinders. And when this happens it feels \*\*GOOD\*\*. For this puzzle to be complete, Recons also need their own Unique and valuable contribution to the team dynamic and I believe restricting spotting to Recon exclusively would not only complete the class system but also solve the tiring and unfulfilling problems of player over-visibility and lack of immersion in the environment, thus improving the game experience massively!

Thanks for listening to my TED talk. I'd love to hear further discussion in the comments.

I downloaded it last night and‚Ä¶wow! One thing I love is the chat on PC. People can type and communicate in chat, and it‚Äôs so easy to play in a server and develop a connection to another player or squad that results in an online friend request and a new person to play with. 

I noticed in the BF6 beta, PC players couldn‚Äôt choose to only play with other PC players. I want that functionality bc I want the chat to be full (the text chat) and want to have the option to maximize my chances to meet people and add them on Steam. If Dice lets us choose to play with other PC players only, then I think that even without a server browser (which I want but don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get outside of Portal), I‚Äôll be a happy man. 

Playing BF4 actually caused me to go ahead and buy BF6.

The maps are quite sprawling but they're fall from empty, and Portal maps are honestly one of the coolest ideas I never considered DICE to pull off in a competent way.

From the bad side, I don't really like the concept of Specialists, Breakthrough seems to be fundamentally broken, the inability to choose a map I want to play on and confinement of the server browser to Portal's ""999999xp do not kill festival"" is incredibly cancerous, but that's honestly not a bad state considering the mess EA is known to leave in other games.

The Devs from BF6 have confirmed with Portal there will be a server browser. In Portal, you will find verified experiences and custom made experiences. Verified being DICE servers, custom made is by Players.

Let's not kid ourselves: who has ever used the game mode search option in BF3 / BF4? Nobody. Everybody used the server browser to find their own experience which fits best for oneself.

Why should open or closed really matter? In the end of the day, most of the players will either way just go into server browsers and filter whatever they want.

Same thing with 12v12 rush. You don't like it? Good, your opinion. But you can modify rush to be 32v32 at release in Portal, so I'm really not sure why ppl are arguing over this stuff? Can someone explain it to me?

Dear Community, after waiting a few days on a reply, today I got advised by the EA Support after reaching out to try and post here/discord/twitter and see if there is support.

Following issue: During the last few hours of the BF6 Open Beta I still grinded to get the Repairing Challenge aswell as the Reach Rank 15 complete - which I manged to do, but during my last few missions the progress bar was stuck and not moving further... For the repairing I played multiple rounds engineer, running after tanks/apc's and repairing only, the bar not moving up further... Same when reaching Rank 15, the bar did not change... The challanges were not yet expired and seemed to be active, but no progress was logged...

Is there still a way to get those rewards? Really would've loved to have those available playing on launch.

Thanks in advance for any support.

My current build was top of the line when I built it 7-8 years ago i9-9990k, 2080ti, 32gb ddr4. Since then, I haven't followed PC parts much at all. I know AMD is the CPU king now, but I don't even know when they surpassed Intel lol.

My PC has served me well, but playing at 1440p on current gen games I'm starting to feel its age. I'm OK playing at low/medium graphics, but after the BF6 beta it got me wanting to go to my next build. Getting only 60~ fps at everything lowest setting felt pretty bad.

This might be a hot take, but ***Specialist personalities.*** Their voice acting is well done and I love how much of a massive variety of voice lines each of them have, for so many different situations and call-outs. Some of them even respond to each other specifically in certain contexts (I had an interaction earlier where Mackay acknowledged a Defend order from Dozer when I pinged his command.) They all sound cool, well-made, and highly characteristic. Mackay is silly but no-nonsense when it matters, Casper is cool-headed and austere, Boris is just fucking awesome. I just like them a lot and I will genuinely miss them.

To be clear, the super cringe voice lines in the game's early lifespan sucked. There's no argument against that - they were ***bad*** and detracted from the experience immensely. However, the characterization of the Specialists and their interactions shined after dev tweaks over time. I always look forward to hearing their one liner whenever I return to the main menu. I've really grown to like them and I'm quite comfortable with them; I'll miss them in BF6. I like the faceless goon aesthetic too, don't get me wrong, but you can still have a masked elite soldier with a bit of characteristic.

2. Casper's drone. Sometimes when I'm sniping, the battleline shifts and I'm no longer in a solid position to provide marksman support but it would take too long for me to shift into a new, better position to help out. So instead I can just pull up the drone and mark the enemies on the point so my allies know what they're getting into. I also enjoy using it to scout ahead of my path to make sure I won't get spotted before getting into a good sniping position - practically guaranteeing that I'm always going to reach a spot where I'll be able to help my team. The drone's versatility is something I've come to bring the full potential out of, and I enjoy it a lot. Not having such a helpful, versatile tool is going to be sad.

3. Angel's versatility. Because of his kit, I can bring a medical pack and support the team and myself in a multitude of different ways. He inherently provides ammo and gadget refills, he can heal if you bring a medpack, and he can revive anybody. I played BF4 for 16 hours (it was fun) and I always felt like I was missing Angel's robust kit. He's great offensively with low ammo-economy weapons and grenades due to ease of self-supply, and he's great at holding a position with your team thanks to his ability to resupply others fully, and (optionally) heal. He's a great comfort pick and I'll miss him.

4. Mackay's grapple hook. I loved using it in intelligent, strategic, and tactical ways. Getting the jump on snipers, getting into better flanking positions, etc. I always felt rewarded for using it well and I'll miss it when I play BF6.

5. Some of the skins are incredible. Mackay's CoD Ghost-style skin (released very early in the game's lifespan) is still one of my most-used, favorite skins on any character in the game.

  
6. Call-ins. Ranger was always fun to play with. He's gotten me plenty of kills, helped me cap a lot of points, and each Specialist even has voice lines for his commands. They didn't \*have\* to code commands for him, but they did, allowing players who want to use him tactically the ability to do so. 



Heli or Jet bothering you? Nobody on your team dealing with it, thinking someone else will do it? Call in a Wildcat and fuck it up. 



Is your team sieging? Got a tank in the garage? Drop it in and roll out.



Call-ins made the battle experience a lot smoother, more consistent, and more fun imo.

In closing, I hope this post shows people that somehow believe 2042 to have no redeeming qualities are very wrong, and I hope that at least some of these qualities will be reimplemented in BF6 in some way or another.

This might be a hot take, but ***Specialist personalities.*** Their voice acting is well done and I love how much of a massive variety of voice lines each of them have, for so many different situations and call-outs. Some of them even respond to each other specifically in certain contexts (I had an interaction earlier where Mackay acknowledged a Defend order from Dozer when I pinged his command.) They all sound cool, well-made, and highly characteristic. Mackay is silly but no-nonsense when it matters, Casper is cool-headed and austere, Boris is just fucking awesome. I just like them a lot and I will genuinely miss them.

To be clear, the super cringe voice lines in the game's early lifespan sucked. There's no argument against that - they were ***bad*** and detracted from the experience immensely. However, the characterization of the Specialists and their interactions shined after dev tweaks over time. I always look forward to hearing their one liner whenever I return to the main menu. I've really grown to like them and I'm quite comfortable with them; I'll miss them in BF6. I like the faceless goon aesthetic too, don't get me wrong, but you can still have a masked elite soldier with a bit of characteristic.

2. Casper's drone. Sometimes when I'm sniping, the battleline shifts and I'm no longer in a solid position to provide marksman support but it would take too long for me to shift into a new, better position to help out. So instead I can just pull up the drone and mark the enemies on the point so my allies know what they're getting into. I also enjoy using it to scout ahead of my path to make sure I won't get spotted before getting into a good sniping position - practically guaranteeing that I'm always going to reach a spot where I'll be able to help my team.

So with Battlefield 2042 and 6 I‚Äôm having problems where it either won‚Äôt fire randomly, will fire in bursts, or I will continue to lay down shots and it will just randomly stop. I can get 5-6 kills normally then the next couple will just have random firing issues. It‚Äôs only an issue with these games and this controller. I‚Äôve tried both the Xbox Elite V2 and PS4 with no issues. It only happens with these 2 games. The other Battlefields work no problem, same with CoD and other shooters.

I‚Äôm really at a loss as I‚Äôd prefer to use this controller and not have to switch to other controllers just for 2 games.

So I wanted to post here and see what sort of a discussion we could create in relation to the BF6 beta and what we all think it needs and doesn't need. Personally I've played every BF game since Bad Company 1 with the exception of Hardline and 2042. Because of this I felt compelled to give my opinion based on what I saw in the beta because Battlefield really is one of my favorite franchises in gaming. Please feel free to comment and discuss what changes you liked and disliked and let's try and spark a great discussion that could result in some positive change. 

I want to start by saying that all in all I actually had a good bit of fun on the beta, and although I have a few things that I believe could be done better I think DICE have a really good base for what could be a really great battlefield game. 

Below are some game mechanics I believe could be refined and changed slightly to produce something truly special. 

Movement speed: I think it would be really easy to change the pace of the game by slowing down movement speed just a tad. Perhaps a mechanic where long periods of running give you a touch of tunnel vision or slight vignette. I think a BF game lends itself to a more tactical style of movement as opposed to jumping round corners and seeing who can get a shot off first. I'd personally welcome a more milsim(ish) style of game play. 

Surpression: I loved the no passive healing  whilst being suppressed mechanic, but there wasn't much physical change to the screen when under fire. I think if being suppressed  had more of an effect on the players screen perhaps we might get more people using it as a tactic as opposed to trying to secure long range kills as a primary defense. 

Awareness assist: So I personally thought something was off with the spotting but couldn't quite put my finger on it. Frequently I could see enemy markers through smoke or walls which just essentially gives the players hacks. I believe if this system were taken away entirely and replaced with a more elaborate ping system that can only be shared primarily amongst squads and then also through squad leaders we might get further reason to use suppression as a tactic. 

Hit markers: I get why a lot of people like hit markers. I just think maybe we could change them? Replace HUD style hit markers for blood spray and you instantly have something that aids the player in feeling immersed in the combat. On top of that I think taking away hit markers means smoke is even more effective because you won't know if you've hit something or not whilst firing through it. This will encourage the further use of suppression. 

To summarise, I think BF6 has the potential to be a really exceptional shooter. With the changes I'm suggesting here I really think this will be one for the fans. Currently though the game feels a bit flat. I think things like HUD based hit markers, fast movement speed and  awareness assist through marked enemies makes the game feel like it's been made to draw another fan based in and not one made for the battlefield fan. Personally I believe that these suggestions might make the game feel more like a team game and drive players to play the objective rather than run around trying to get as many kills as possible. 

Please let me know what you think about these ideas! I'm excited to see what the community feeling is and let's see what new ideas we can come up with.

DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) are no joke. If you are sitting still for multiple hours, you aren't using your leg muscles (especially calve muscles). Your blood can't return back to the heart by itself as it has lost most of its speed by the time it gets to returning to the heart, so your calve muscles squeeze to help move the blood back to the heart. If you aren't using your calve muscles (i.e. you've been sitting for too long - commonly due to a long flight, a long surgery or an average Battlefield gaming session) then you are at risk of your blood remaining still (stagnant). Sometimes, this blood can clot. This is very dangerous as the clot can dislodge and get stuck in your heart or lungs, leading to serious problems like pulmonary embolism or cardiomyopathy which can cause arrhythmias and death. You can't PTFO if you're dead. Think of this as tactically redeploying so you're out of the action of the game for a short duration but then you're back with full ammo and max grenades.

PCIE3 msata from old build with Windows11


**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

PC build with old 500W PSU and drives from old build.

CPU is extremely hot compared to my earlier Ryzen 5 3600, never saw it below 70 degrees.
Can set the fans to max, temps dont change.

Didnt boot the first time when both sticks where inserted.

PC randomly just shuts off, non-replicable but not under load.

BF6 Beta played without problems, Helldivers 2 sets gpu fans on max (but I thinks its a rather unoptimized game).

As of now it always happend while watching yt videos in Edge, some times 5 minutes after a cold start, some times after hours of gaming and then switching over to watching videos.


**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Thought of PSU being underpowered so I changed the 500W PSU, issue still happening.

Cleaned former nvidia drivers, still happening.

Redone thermal paste twice (initially with the cooler provided paste in a thicker layer, 
then the old school pea sized drop, then two thin lines spaced apart but that dropped temps in idle from 80 to 75), no change, temps still high.

Going to change the CPU for a newer Ryzen 5 running not that hot, cant rule out that the board
interprets the always high temps (average 86 degrees on CPU, 95 on package according to 
HWMonitor) as reason to shut of when load goes away.

There was a dev comment screenshot posted here saying they are 'looking into' the autospotting, but that's equally concerning because most people agree it simply needs to be removed and recon should get an alternative passive. It doesn't need to be adjusted, it needs to be deleted.

The bigger problem is a lack of server browser and persistent lobbies. I won't go into when this is such a big issue as it's been discussed to death but it's huge, especially for players like me in lower pop regions. We will probably have a server browser in Portal but it may not have persistent lobbies and Portal itself may be hidden in the atrocious Netflix UI. Also no mention of changes to the UI, which is universally hated. 

The changes addressed in the debrief are good, but we should be worried about the omission of these two major pain points for the community.

I have sone maybe 15 matches in hazard zone now and this one seems it will take forever. Do people not play for the objectives or extractions? I still dont fully 100% get what you're supposed to do aside from collecting the data and extracting but it seems like if I stay with the group, the ones I've been in, they go to a location no where near data files or extraction points but of I go by myself i tend to get smoked.

1mwyzdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,,0,Battlefield has always been fast-paced,Repeat34,False,True,False,,False,"Battlefield has been ‚ÄúCOD-like‚Äù ever since BF3. As someone who‚Äôs sunk thousands of hours into every Battlefield since then‚Äîalong with plenty of time in Arma, Squad, Hell Let Loose, and Tarkov‚ÄîI honestly don‚Äôt understand why players keep complaining about fast-paced movement (within reason, of course‚Äînot teleporting like BF4 or exploiting ledge glitches in the beta).

**Here‚Äôs the core issue:** Battlefield maps and gameplay were never designed around slow, tactical movement. The reason Arma, Squad, and Tarkov *do* work with slower pacing is because nearly every design decision in those games supports realism‚Äîor at least the perception of it. Things like stamina bars, stricter health systems, massive spread-out maps, and limited spawn mechanics are all built to force slower, methodical play.

Battlefield is the opposite. It has always thrived on chaos, spectacle, and streamlined mechanics. Huge maps with tons of cover, vehicles flying overhead, instant squad spawns, and dozens of players crashing into objectives all at once. If you try to force slower pacing into that environment, Battlefield stops feeling like Battlefield‚Äîit just becomes a worse version of Arma or Squad (and a headglitch fest at that).

Fast movement has always been part of Battlefield‚Äôs identity, and frankly, it‚Äôs what makes it fun. Even in the BF6 beta, it‚Äôs still the *slowest* Battlefield we‚Äôve had since BF3‚Äîeven with the knife out. A lot of the ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù clips people point to are just movement glitches, and even when they aren‚Äôt, that kind of movement usually hurts the player more than it helps.

It really feels like some people want Battlefield to turn into Arma or Squad. And I say this as someone who *loves* those games‚Äîif that‚Äôs what you want, go play them! They scratch that itch perfectly. But Battlefield has always been an arcade shooter at its core, and trying to slow it down or ‚Äúrealism it up‚Äù ruins what makes it unique.

I‚Äôd genuinely like to hear any solid counterarguments or feedback, but for me, Battlefield‚Äôs fast-paced, chaotic movement is a feature, not a flaw. And the last thing I want is for it to become another watered-down version of COD or some pseudo-milsim clone.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwyzdt/battlefield_has_always_been_fastpaced/,Battlefield,1755843959.0,16,0.4,Battlefield 6

So treating it as a BF themed hero-shooter game and to my surprise it's quite fun and less fatiguing to play than bf6 beta. Would recommend (just not as a proper BF), quicks thoughts after playing:

Pros:
-Huge maps with various verticality and weathers and it's going for that big BF sandbox experience (opposite of BF6 beta) which I love.

-Excellent gun and vehicle selections and customizations, especially vehicles

-128 players on the right maps

Cons:
-Many map elements are too generic and sterile, obvious downgrades from previous titles. (tho still prefer it over the cramped bf6 maps)

I have two points reasons that work for me, but I acknowledge that everyone has a different play style. 

1.  Smg preferred weapon means you have slightly better hip fire control. Hip fire control on an smg is already very easy to manage and it has a diminishing return after a certain point. However, if you're running an LMG, being able to run just as fast as everyone else when you're being a team player is crucial! Switching to a knife to keep up with the squad when everyone has guns out isn't always viable. 

2.  LMG is a great support weapon. I'm not running out being the tip of the spear for my squad. I'm laying down sustained fire to cover my team while they advance regardless of map size. That L110 200x round mag says that no enemy is peaking that alley while my assault or recon mates are moving up. 
If whoever is in front of me goes down, I'm prefiring my gun around the corner and sweeping the WHOLE  room while peaking the corner until I see that kill marker pop up. This got me more kills in close quarters against smg/assault/carbine users than anything else. 

I ran a mix of closed and open games. I prefer closed weapons, yes I'll miss SMG on Support, but I can always run a different class or play around with whichever carbine best works close range, which happened to be the meta in beta. 
 
I think having the LMG speed buff is higher value than the small smg handling buff and the LMG is useful on maps of all sizes in team play. On bigger maps like Liberation Peak I'd switch to a silenced, fast mag, hs multiplier on the KTS100. Small maps was 200 mag L110. 

Don't even get me started on if you catch a squad unaware and you can just mow them all down... This beta actually made me enjoy using an LMG finally after all the years of being a smg/dmr main, switching between the two based on the map, and it felt good. My only complaint in LMG vs SMG is that I felt like SMGs  were too good at a distance in BF6 which was my second most played weapon class (I tried them all out) and LMGs do need a more impactful suppression effect.

I am only making this post to see if there have been any updates, or workarounds that have been discovered recently due to these CPU's being locked out from undervolting. 

I own an Acer Nitro 5 laptop with an i7-12650H/4060. My clockspeed/voltages are either full balls to the wall to the point of thermal throttling and destroying performance or not, no in between. I have messed with throttlestop some but I'm not having too much luck with it.

Keep in mind, I've had this laptop for a year, this has been the case since the day I bought it, I even have a laptop cooling pad, I have yet to change the thermal paste though < Might be my problem?

I often disable the intel ""Turbo Boost"" through throttlestop. Which is fine as I'm still able to get optimal performance in a majority of modern titles. Sadly with some more recent games this isn't the case. 

My CPU gets around 70c with it running at around 25-30 watts at 2.3ghz with turbo boost disabled on the default fan settings in NitroSense, the fans are only slightly audible. 

I really, really, really, just wish I could have more control over my voltages/frequencys, as Nitro sense on its own just simply is not enough. 

This became very apparent in the recent BF6 beta.  Seeing my laptop perform like a 1660TI desktop PC is pretty disheartening. 

  
Sorry for the rant - TL:DR - Any recent workarounds for undervolting or changing the frequency's of  an i7 12650h.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like it will be in any of the maps, doesn‚Äôt seem like swimming is even a mechanic of the game. Is there any updates on whether it‚Äôll come to the game perhaps in a future update? I‚Äôd sell my kidneys for a paracel storm remake, and even an entire naval warfare season post launch that brings back carrier assault. I know this game will focus heavily on Europe and America rather than the pacific like BF4. But come on a naval warfare update with maps in the Bahamas, Florida Keys or hell even Ibiza would be awesome. 

2. How does customisation work? We obviously know we are getting soldier skins but is it going to be like 2042 and other cod games? Or is it going to be like BFV with its outfit packs and the ability to mix and match packs? I‚Äôve always thought BFV had the perfect customisation mechanic it was just hindered by stupid skins that betrayed the ww2 aesthetic, it wasn‚Äôt very immersive being revived by the phantom of the opera. On the other hand when DICE dropped the more historically accurate skins for all the factions it was awesome and being able to mix and match packs was even cooler. Would love to see this feature return as it offered so much more player choice than operator skins we got in 2042. Also skins will be locked to either faction right? Surely?

Cause it got refunded within 2 hours/ 4 Online games.

Where do I start? 

\#1) Ping/Server issues.... I played 4 online games, all over 60+ ping (I get 20-30 in EVERY other game I play, even less with some like Fortnite/OW). The passing was delayed, the animations were SO emphasized, and I felt like my players were playing in Ice the whole time... Which I felt I had very little control over my defenders.... Which leads me to point #2

\#2) Defense and Defenders.... I have NEVER had an easier time passing 97 VVD then I did today. All 4 games had SEVERAL goals within 30 minutes. I had one game.... 13-9.... another 12-5, and another 12-6 (all wins btw, still didnt have fun)....This is coming from past games where I pride myself in defending, but no matter WHAT setting I did... I felt like I could not defend AT ALL... and my Ops were the same way

\#3) WHY ARE THEY GIVING US TOTW 97's TO TEST THE GAME??? the whole point is to play the game with low level cards like we would at the start..... Why give me 99 Pace Mbappe that can run around all of the team without anyone stopping him? and that leads to #4

\#4) Dribbling and Offense is CRRAAZZZYYYY strong.... the fact that there was a goal in EVERY GAME within the first kickoff was nuts, legit every game started with a kickoff goal. The ""run down the line cut back"" meta is still there, dribbling felt WAY too good on a player like Hansen, she shouldnt just R1 run and sprint around the whole pitch....

All and All, I still see the SAME glaring issues that plagued FC25 and I simply cannot put myself thru another year of this game. SO glad I got a chance to save myself the pain, onto BF6 and Borderlands 4 :)

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof.

Puske i pucanje su odlicne (tu je po meni za neke puske manja zamerka malo slabiji recoil ali to mogu da poprave do oktobra, mada je to EA pa se nikad ne zna), mape su po meni sasvim zadovoljavajuce mada bi trebali da dodaju nekoliko vecih mapa do izlaska igrice.

1mwuwff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwuwff/as_a_dominationkoth_exclusive_enjoyer_bf6_is/,,1,"As a Domination/KOTH Exclusive Enjoyer, BF6 Is ALMOST Perfect",GarageDoorOpener2,False,True,False,,False,"As someone who doesn't usually play Battlefield, playing BF6's Call of Duty-esque game modes was extremely enjoyable for me. For the first time in a long time, I got my casual balls to the walls brainrot fix from Domination and KOTH, something that I didn't think was going to happen. Obviously, I know the wider Battlefield community will not be playing it all that much, but I got a lot of BO2 and XDefiant vibes from these game modes and it made me sit down for nearly ten hours straight on the first day of global beta access. 

It also helped that it still had some Battlefield flavor with revives, support, and a stronger emphasis on objective play. I really liked how I could slay out and cap flags or push hills at the same time, while pulling my squadmates away from gunfire so my team would have more help putting pressure on the enemies. It was always very satisfying to see myself on the top of the scoreboard of my team almost every single time because the way these modes are set up makes it very easy to do both simultaneously. It's real good fun.

There are a couple of issues with these game modes, though, and I think they're actually pretty simple to implement.

The first thing I would change is to actually make the respawn timer longer. In contrast to Conquest, these game modes have it where you can respawn immediately after being downed, and then the game decides where you spawn as opposed to picking your spawn yourself.

Now, I really like games where I can die and immediately get back in with very little downtime, which, if I'm being honest, is why Battlefield never really caught my interest in the past. But, I would argue that the timer to respawn is too quick. Because the objective is more pronounced in Battlefield as opposed to other games, having as many people around the objective is a good strat if you're trying to get time on the hill during KOTH for example.

So what ends up happening is that in most lobbies, people tend to forego reviving or dropping medpacks because its assumed that you'll just spawn right back in. But this is counter intuitive because the game usually spawns you pretty far away from the objective after dying, which means that it's extremely hard to actually make a comeback, unless your team can get the jump on the next point, or the next rotation on Domination. And if a medic or squadmate is nearby, players decide to bleed out when they were just about to revived, which has happened both to me and happened to many medics that I've given up on because I was convinced no one would revive me.

So if the timer is just a little slower, then this problem may be fixed.

Another issue is that at least with a couple maps, some of the objective spots were a little poorly thought out. The best example I can give is on Empire State KOTH, where the D hill is at that Gazebo spot. On that hill, almost no one can get time on it because the bounds of that hill are so wide that both teams are always constantly on it, and if one team does happen to take control, the other team virtually can't make any play to take control themselves because of the layout of the hill. Some objectives just need some adjusting, and while I can't give specific feedback on how to fix them, at the very least I can make it known that it's a bit of a frustrating issue.

Other than that, I don't really think I have much to say other than what everyone else is saying. Nerf movement a little bit, nerf shotgun, wipe with some elbow grease, and we should be good to go. I had a lot of fun with these game modes and I'm excited to potentially main BF6 for a good while.

Before playing this game, I've only seen it on steam or just the cover for it, and then I watch a video made by Tbag Gaming which showed gameplay that caught my interest. The gameplay looked pretty similar to battlefield and the beta for bf6 just ended recently so I thought I'd try out the game on PS5

It's day 2 of playing the game, so I tried out the operations mode and my first real warfare match after doing a practice with AI. And I just feel so confused overall. I see that there's a campaign story but I don't see where to play it? Is it through the operations? The Black Hawk Down mission? Or something else I'm not seeing? I watch these cutscenes with these characters and the villain being broken out of a prison, but nothing about a campaign story about them to play, at least not that I can see on the game.

The controls are a mess in my opinion, mainly the keybinds for gadgets, I have a lot of moments where I'm trying to use one thing and keep pulling out another. The menu navigation feels annoying, because I can't seem to back out completely and view every mode or option there is, but I'm instead forced to switch between them. The controls sometimes actually bug out and you can't do stuff on random menus including when trying to deploy in a match, or the cursor will just completely disable itself at random times.

Not sure how I feel about operators but they're okay I guess, at least this game seems to be made for them unlike 2042. Is this supposed to be mainly multiplayer where the story and context is just in cutscenes or something?

I really hope the game improves on console over time, because I don't want to drop it already. If anyone has any starting advice, I'd appreciate it.",False,/r/DeltaForceGlobal/comments/1mwuvfw/this_game_has_me_confused/,DeltaForceGlobal,1755830503.0,6,0.67,Discussion üó£Ô∏è

They hosted all the popular games and had an incredible forum that I have  many fond memories of. A lot of work went into this infrastructure of hosting servers for games and interesting to see how that job has basically died and been replaced with no name or face AWS/kubernetes style automations which are completely soulless. How can we bring back the sense of community that once existed on these platforms in today's modern cloud infrastructure economy? What happened to clans?

Capture drives,
Survive,
Exfil,
Repeat

What I don't understand or don't fully understand is the following:

When capturing hard drives, do enemies get any information on where I am and what I'm doing?

Can multiple teams share one exfil?

What do I need to grab to call my squad back from death? (is it the unlink things?)

Are there only 2 chances to exfil?

What exactly is the point of capturing hard drives?

And lastly, the typical question that I am sure has been asked numerous times regarding this

Are the only people left playing it the people who only play this mode and do they purposely ignore drives just to hunt squads? Thats been my experience in the few matches I've had.

The trophies are as follows:

Extract without anyone dying in your squad (I wish I could turn squad fill off for this)

Extract 25 times (sounds painful)

Hi,

I couldn't figure it out by myself, so here I am.

Recently, I upgraded to an RX 9070XT in order to enjoy BF6 as it is due, but for some reason, while trying to play 2042 for the free pass, I get this weird freezing every other 5 seconds.

What I've tried:  
\- Minimum or maximum settings are not related to the regularity of the freezes.  
\- Limiting FPS doesn't help either, I've tried game settings and RivaTunner fps limiter.  
\- Resolution doesn't help, I've tried 1080p and lower resolutions.  
\- I reinstalled the game, didn't help.  
\- I moved the game from one SSD to another, it is not that.

System Summary:  
\- Ryzen 7 5800X  
\- RX 9070XT  
\- 32 GB Ram at 3200MHz  
\- Windows 11 Pro 24H2

Additional notes:  
\- Whenever the game is not freezing, I get up to 270-300 frames, with an average of 230.  
\- All drivers are up to date.  
\- It only happens with this game.  
\- Computer OS was clean formatted a week ago to install windows 11.  
\- Between formatting date and new GPU installation, the issue didn't happen with my previous GPU (RTX 3070)  
\- I understand there is a GPU bottleneck happening in my system when playing at 1080p (new 2k monitor on the way yay!), but I believe this isn't enough to justify the random CPU usage I'm seeing while playing this game (jumping from 100% to 20% whenever the game freezes as seen in the video), since I've played heavier games such as Cyberpunk 2077 with full ray tracing at 60fps for hours.

Long time lurker, and finally a first time poster. Got my first rig about a year ago. Before you crucify me, I didn't know about the subreddit and kinda bought blindly after doing *some* research and what seemed like a good deal at the time. Got an MSI Aegis R9 (yeah, now I know...). 

It's got: 

MSI PRO B760 WiFi 7
i9 14900f 
MSI Ventus 2X OC 4070 
32GB Ram 

Ventilation is decent, not superb, with the GPU staying around 55-60c with both GPU fans and case fans blowing like an F35. To be fair I have not looked at CPU temps (away from home for a few days so can't really check either). 

Been looking into upgrading into a 5080, solely because the 4070 seems to be lagging behind, and it's not anywhere near max game settings. I'm usually on COD, will be on BF6 (the beta didn't really play great on my rig), Cities Skyline II, Fallout, Chornobyl, RDR2 etc. I try to dip into a bit of everything where and when I can. Also been trying to play Alan Wake 2, as I played the first one on console many years ago and have heard awesome things about it. 

Besides from a 5080, looking to upgrade:

-PSU as my PC came with a non modular 750w unit. Been looking at Corsair RMe RM1000e 80+ gold 
-Add Corsair iCue Link TITAN 240RX AIO, currently just air cooled 
-MSI RTX5080 16G GAMING TRIO OC to replace my 4070 

Now, my question to the PCMR is: is this worth my time upgrading these components, knowing the 14900f is not the ideal CPU for gaming? Would these components make a difference on my gaming experience? I might not be able to max out settings, I totally get that, but I'm hoping it delivers better and more consistent gameplay than the frame drops or the ghosting from frame gen (when on) on the 4070. 

You can totally tell me I'm delusional, and this crap will never behave the way I'm wanting it to. Just looking for smooth, 1440p gaming with low input lag and decent frame rates at a good visual setting. 

Bonus question: would an eBay sourced 4090 be a good choice? Non FE versions seem to range from $1600-$3400. I'm a little skittish buying something that expensive knowing I might get something totally different. 

Lastly, please feel free to chime in and recommend any further upgrades or different parts from what I've described above. 

Really appreciate y'all. Hoping to make this happen.

Part of what made the older Battlefields feel so good was that weapon choice was tied to class. You instantly knew what role someone was playing, and it forced teamwork, recons handled long range, medics supported with their kit, engineers dealt with vehicles, and assaults pushed the line.

In BF6‚Äôs beta, it feels like class choice doesn‚Äôt matter because you can just equip whatever gun you want. To me, that takes away from both immersion and balance.

On top of that, I‚Äôd love sniper glint to only mean ‚Äúrecon with a scope aimed at you.‚Äù Not a medic with a health bag camping a hill and a sniper rifle.

So, for example, if you don't like the inherent randomness of matchmaking, you could create a custom Portal server (that is persistent) and pick the map rotation you want, maybe increase the ticket count, disallow some weapons/gadgets if you'd like, etc. and call your server something memorable like ""Reggie's Awesome Server!!!"" (or ""! Turtles"" or ""! Flubber"" or ""! STONKS"" √† la some of the popular BF4 servers). If enough people like that configuration, more and more people will join it and you'd have that classic Battlefield community that way.

Maybe if you are a part of a community on Discord or something you can have links/codes to your Portal servers so everyone in your community plays on the same server(s). That's not to mention the mountains of improvements and additional customization they added to BF6's Portal compared to 2042.

This way, they get to keep matchmaking for the majority of players who don't care about the ""community"" aspect of a persistent server and just want to play the fucking game. Plus you can still select a gamemode and/or map using custom search, which I expect to be improved even more before launch.

It also means that you don't have this ridiculous, endless list of ""[DICE] Conquest US East #21144"" that you have to wade through to find a map/gamemode you want to play. I remember that being a really, really annoying thing about past Battlefield games.

Another thing I'm confused about is the whole ""official"" server thing. The devs have said that they'd have ""verified"" servers that, if a server is customized within reason (i.e. true to a normal Battlefield experience), you can receive full XP as if it were an ""official"" server. Isn't that the same effect as actual official servers?

Also, with respect to the criticism of, ""well, Portal is a hidden feature and not the main menu so nobody will use it,"" then maybe they can advertise popular Portal servers on the home page in addition to the normal matchmaking servers? It could be a section like, ""Your friends [on EA Connect] frequently play these Portal servers"" or something similar. Remember to fill out the Open Beta survey with your suggestions because I know I will!

I know this subreddit can get... heated, but I genuinely want to know why this isn't literally a perfect solution. Is it just a lack of trust that they will deliver?

P.S. I've played this franchise since about 2012 starting with BF3 so I am a true ""BaTtLeFieLd vEtERaN"" or whatever.

i personally loved it, i primarily played support and engineer, having ammo/medic bag in one, made me feel really important to all infantry when pushing, keeping everyone revived, full health/ammo, and obscured in smoke as they pushed, and i grew really attached to the LMG because i could be a jack of all trades, CQB decent, Midrange Great, Long range Solid. especially for suppressing snipers, keeping their eyes on me not my team even if i could not kill them.

but this also translated to Engineer, having an LMG as engineer felt right, being behind a tank means very often being at the forefront of the battle and having an LMG to suppress and have enough ammo in one mag to take out 3-4 enemies that are on an objective really helps. i also took out a few Heli pilots when they paused for an missile volley.

  
one aspect i love about battlefield is that you cannot be ready for every situation, and many situations are unfair, but there is always a counter. of course there should be balance, but having open weapons feels right IMHO, if someone is abusing the shotgun, bring longer ranged weapons or explosives, or take a shotgun and give them a taste of their medicine. likewise with a crackshot enemy sniper, bring or communicate to a tank to send some HE his way, or countersniper, or in my case suppress with 100 rnds of lead.

but i have not heard any serious argument for why Closed weapons is better than Open weapons, other than its new/ harder to balance. and i would really like to understand that opinion.

1mwom82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwom82/a_little_bf_history_to_bring_the_current_movement/,,5,A little BF history to bring the current movement discussion into perspective.,dontdxmebro,False,True,False,,False,"Alright, let's talk about something. I'm an old. I'm 33. I've been playing BF since 1942 and really got into it with BF2. In that time I've done everything from the vaunted 8v8 competitive infantry leagues in BF2, the much much larger vehicle maps with 64 players and then continuing all the way until BFV. My favorites being probably BF4, BF1 and BF2.

Movement has basically always been a contentious issue in this game and I find generally all sides of the current argument just a massive circlejerk when you put the history of this discussion into perspective.

**Battlefield 2**

To start, do any of you remember the BF2 Demo? The meta the game shipped with? My god it was a movement fiasco. You were able to spam prone, movement speed was high, and jumping distance put Olympians to shame. This was deemed ""dolphin diving."" Not only this - but you could throw C4 like Cal Ripken, so this led to one of the craziest metas I've ever experienced: the dolphin diving + C4 chucking meta. Completely absurd, kind of fun in a weird way - but so far beyond what we're dealing with right now.

Dolphin diving continued to be a topic of debate in the community for the entirety of BF2's existence even as they nerfed movement and the C4 tossing distance. It was in some respects¬†*much*¬†harder to counter then the recent discussions around CoD movement depending on the situation. You could do this strafe to the side, jump, insta prone thing that you definitely can't do in any modern BF. Eventually it was tamed down quite a bit but still there was a divide between the jumpy prone spam people and the people who think playing Battlefield is like a 1:1 real life simulator.

Some of the maps people look back upon like 64 player Karkand? Complete joke. You have not seen nade spam unless you played Infantry Only Karkand in 2006. A rain of powerful grenades that made Metro look tame.

In some respects BF2 is still my favorite Battlefield. The map design was my favorite. Air power had a high skill ceiling but if you were good you were dominant. Tanks and vehicles movement felt great and they felt scary to come up against but not OP, however I do believe a lot of this is nostalgia. I haven't played in ages but usually when I go back to games this old it feels way worse then I remember it feeling and it lacks a lot of modern QOL features.

**Battlefield Bad Company 2**

Everyone loves BC2 now, but back then it was a source of controversy that seems very familiar... lots of claims about smaller maps ruining what makes Battlefield great and venerating the vaunted ""Big Maps with Vehicles."" The graphics, style and hitmarkers were all signs of the CoD-ification of battlefield. Rush mode was instant gratification trash against the purity and tactical supremacy of Conquest. The series would never be the same.

In reality, I had tons of fucking fun with BC2. It was different then BF2 and slightly dumbed down, but generally more unserious. The map design and smaller player count was a big downside though, but destruction was cool.

**Battlefield 3-4**

Clumping these together because they're pretty similar. The same discussion remained. Battlefield maps were smaller then they used to be and they're just trying to piggyback on Call of Duty. People complained about bunnyhoppers and shotgun users and AEK sweats and the world went on. Battlefield 4 had the worst launch of any Battlefield but they managed to turn it into one of the best Battlefields even if it took 2-3 years. It had bigger BF2 style maps, it had good gunplay, it had some attempts at doing something new, and movement was in a decent spot.

**Battlefield 1**

It got interesting with BF1 because the movement was even more nerfed then before. You could slide but bunny hopping was gone, prone spam was useless and it seemed like it had the movement all the complainers finally wanted but was seen as dumbed down by many. The introduction of random spread to automatic weapons and other penalties led to claims of them dumbing down the series and making it more RNG friendly.

Personally, I love BF1. You could still movement your way out of dying but the really absurd stuff was taken out. Loved the infantry bolt action rifles actually being quite powerful and fun to use. Didn't mind the sweet spot mechanic so much and the weapon balance is one of the best in the whole series other then the random spread mechanics, but it was unique because of its setting.

**Battlefield 5**

Battlefield 5 actually didn't contribute that much to the movement discussion. It's problems remained in the EA community support, the weird cultural shit happening with people whining about there being women and black people in the game and things like not including any of the famous battles of the war on launch. Lots of very strange design decisions - but in the end the gunplay and map design were actually very good. The gunplay and movement especially are top tier, which is one of the reason BFV was so disappointing to me. It was a very fun game somewhat ruined by poor decisions at the top. I stopped playing after this and I'm glad I skipped 2042.

**In Conclusion:**

Not only am I writing this shitty novel because I have an hour to kill at a coffee shop until a meeting, I'm here to say - the discussion on movement is not something new. The ""Call of Duty-ificiation"" you all speak of has literally been the same shit since BC2 came out in¬†**two thousand fucking ten**. 15 years ago. Movement has ALWAYS been split between the sweats and the milsim guys. It has always been like this. It may be more pronounced now because select sweats have made careers out of being sweaty with people watching and social media becoming more prolific but there is nothing more consistent then half the community whining about this debate. BF6 is in my opinion, a pretty good spot for a release and I didn't find it to be too sweaty if I'm real. It more just had a low TTK and the map design in some cases is just... bad.

I'm not saying anyone is correct either. While I will always be a bit of a sweat in spirit, I understand there needs to be a happy medium. The Warzone movement shit is pretty whack, so I'm glad they're nerfing movement a bit. Go play Apex if that kind of game is what you want. Warzone will always be a deadbeat dad, abusive boyfriend game and/or a screechy child's toy. Don't play Warzone.

When it comes to the milsim dudes, why are you here? Go play Squad. Squad and games like Arma Reforger are right there, just for you - and they have far more access to vibrant and dedicated communities then we did back in the Project Reality days. You might even be able to get some kills with your sloth reaction times and old man ass attitude about gaming.

At what point do you consider repasting and replacing thermal pads?

Done a little research on replacing the thermal pads, is there no better way than trial and error to figure out what thickness pads you need?

Is the change meant to address that?

I really enjoyed how player movement felt in the game during the beta, and I personally never did this weird spamming motion or saw anybody else doing it. While im sure there were plenty, and there would be more as time went on, I‚Äôm just concerned that they may clubfoot the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù movement as well. Hopefully this fix addresses the abuse, but doesn‚Äôt hamper typical player movement. 

I love the grounded nature of this new iteration in the franchise, but I wouldn‚Äôt want it to go so far as to feel like a MILSIM game with sluggish movement.

I‚Äôve got a 5700x3d 32gb 3200mhz and a 9070xt

Before the update I got stutters every so often (only on this game not on any others ) 

Bf6 ran 140fps no problem with no frame gen 

Why does this game use 100% of my cpu all the time now , I can‚Äôt play won‚Äôt multiple seconds worth of input lag when it randomly stutters , happens on lowest graphics settings or on highest tried with a bunch of different settings and different resolutions (I currently play on 5120x1440p)

When I first saw people up there, I thought ""look at those losers"". Then I thought why not try it before it gets fixed.

Once I got up there I landed a few unfair kills and yes it did feel kinda gross lol... until I got sniped halfway across the map from what appears to be another out of bounds spot at the other spawn.

Don't you think it would've been cool if they actually integrated the rooftops into the map? Clean up all the out of bounds save for 2 and create more detailed assets for those spots that blend well with the rest of the map AND make them destructible (or at least the way leading to them) so that there is only limited opportunity to take advantage of the height advantage. One on either side of the map, one for each team, and maybe only accessible at points B and E so that attacking points A and F isn't a total nightmare, but keep the challenge of actually getting up there in place somehow so that there is some downside to make the snipers master their movement a bit more you know.

I mean Battlefield was always about fighting the opposition on different levels right. Infantry and their respective classes, light vehicles, heavy vehicles, tanks, anti-air, jets, and helos.

I just think it would be pretty cool if another level was added to the mix for the snipers (I think they'd get less hate lol) where they can battle it out... implemented as described above.

**Jets** need to have better flight controls (Please Look at War Thunders flying controls as an example. NOTE: I'm not asking for War Thunders damage system).

**Helicopters** need to have there BF4 movement return & the Anti-Air needs to be nerfed because having Anti-Air guns at Objectives, Anti-Air Tanks, Anti-Air at HQ Spawns & Anti-Air Personal Missiles (Stingers) is just to much for Helicopters to deal with right now.

**Tanks** need to be made stronger but in return repairing shouldn't be as strong as it currently is. With the current system the Tanks feel terrible when you are by yourself operating them but if you have a few people repairing your tank you will become a nearly unstoppable force which isn't super fun to fight against. (Even if its Epic).

***Weapons:***

**DMR's** need rebalanced they felt terrible to use & almost no one I played with used them & almost no one I went against was using them.

The **Shotgun** needs nerfed (I know this is gonna happen but I just wanted to make the point here).

**Snipers** need to have there sweet spot mechanic removed, Its not fun at all to die to someone & not be able to get revived just because they camped themselves at the perfect distance.

***Systems:***

**Bloom** on ALL forms of weapons NEEDS to be removed!!! Dying because my bullets didn't go where I aimed is one of the worst feelings in this game right now & it NEEDS to go. Bloom is one of the biggest reasons as to why I stopped playing BF1.

Certain maps need to have there **Spawns** worked on for objectives the biggest example I can give on this is the C objective on Empire State currently the spawn system just spawns you into the open which is not acceptable.

**Reviving** needs some improvements, Right now reviving by dragging people feels great but reviving with Defibrillators feels off & not natural.

The **Scoreboard** needs some improvements, This will sound ironic but BF2042 currently has a better Scoreboard that BF6.

A j√°t√©k futtat√°s√°hoz ugyanis UEFI + Secure Boot volt az aj√°nlott (s≈ët, sok esetben k√∂telez≈ë) rendszerfelt√©tel, ami rengeteg g√©pen nem volt alapb√≥l aktiv√°lva - vagy √©pp nem is volt el√©rhet≈ë.

# Technikai h√°tt√©r ‚Äì mi is az a Secure Boot √©s UEFI?

* **Secure Boot**: egy biztons√°gi protokoll, ami csak megb√≠zhat√≥ oper√°ci√≥s rendszert enged elindulni. Ez seg√≠t megakad√°lyozni a rootkit-eket √©s egy√©b t√°mad√°sokat.
* **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: a modern BIOS, ami gyorsabb bootol√°st, jobb biztons√°got √©s t√∂bb funkci√≥t k√≠n√°l. De teljes √°talakul√°st kell elv√©gezni BIOS-on bel√ºl, ha ebbe belementek.
* **Legacy BIOS + MBR**: a r√©gi rendszer, amit sok j√°t√©kos m√©g mindig haszn√°l, f≈ëleg r√©gebbi g√©peken.

A gond? A Secure Boot **csak UEFI GPT-m√≥dban m≈±k√∂dik**, √©s ha valaki Legacy BIOS-ban van, akkor **√°t kell konvert√°lni a rendszer√©t GPT-re**, ami m√°r nem egy kattint√°s - hanem egy potenci√°lisan adatveszt√©ssel j√°r√≥ m≈±velet

Steam statisztik√°k - h√°ny j√°t√©kost √©rint ez?

A Steam Hardware Survey alapj√°n:

* **UEFI-t haszn√°l√≥ g√©pek ar√°nya**: nem k√∂zvetlen√ºl m√©rik, de az adatokb√≥l √©s a Windows 11 kompatibilit√°si statisztik√°kb√≥l becs√ºlhet≈ë, hogy **kb. 80‚Äì85%** m√°r modern UEFI rendszeren fut. Teh√°t a gamerek T√ñBBS√âGE m√°r modern configra v√°ltott
* **MBR part√≠ci√≥val rendelkez≈ë g√©pek**: becsl√©sek szerint **10‚Äì15%** lehet, f≈ëleg r√©gebbi g√©peken - Ennek legal√°bb 5-6% v√°lthat √°t UEFI-re a BF6 megjelen√©s miatt
* **Secure Boot akt√≠v g√©pek**: szint√©n nem k√∂zvetlen√ºl m√©rik, de a Windows 11 k√∂vetelm√©nyek miatt **kb. 70‚Äì75%** m√°r aktiv√°lta vagy enged√©lyezte.

Ez alapj√°n **kb. 10‚Äì15%** lehet az a j√°t√©kosr√©teg, akik **technikai okokb√≥l nem tudt√°k elind√≠tani a BF6 b√©t√°t**, vagy nem mert√©k el≈ërendelni, mert nem akartak beleny√∫lni a BIOS-ba.

‚ÄûEz az els≈ë j√°t√©k, ami miatt a BIOS-hoz kellett ny√∫lnom. Ez nem norm√°lis.‚Äù 

‚ÄûUninstall, √©s felejts√ºk el. Nem fogom kock√°ztatni a g√©pem egy j√°t√©k miatt.‚Äù 

‚ÄûSecure Boot? M√©g a nev√©t se hallottam, am√≠g a BF6 el nem j√∂tt.‚Äù

A Steam f√≥rumokon √©s Redditen is rengeteg panasz √©rkezett, f≈ëleg azokra a g√©pekre, ahol **nincs TPM**, vagy **a BIOS nem t√°mogatja az UEFI-t**. Ez k√ºl√∂n√∂sen f√°j√≥ volt azoknak, akik **r√©gi, de m√©g er≈ës g√©peken** j√°tszanak.

A Battlefield 6 nem csak a j√°t√©kmenet√©vel, hanem a technikai k√∂vetelm√©nyeivel is megosztotta a Battlefield PC-s rajong√≥i k√∂z√∂ss√©get. B√°r a Secure Boot √©s UEFI val√≥ban biztons√°gosabb √©s modernebb, a PC gaming szabads√°g√°nak r√©sze az is, hogy ne kelljen BIOS-t buher√°lni egy j√°t√©k miatt. √âs ez jogos.

First time I jumped in Cairo it felt so cinematic, from the map detail to the smoke and explosion effects. Would be awesome to watch fights in spectator mode from above. 

It would be double awesome to be able to playback matches we played. Like in league of legends you can play back your games and watch as everything happens, you can slow it down and watch high intensity moments in their fullest from any angle. How could would that be for when you go on large kill streaks or epic moments? Get to watch bullets fly in slow motion. Also you would see some cool edits of people being able to capture their moment

hopefully we at least get basic tier which is just regular spectator mode.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mwifpc/spectator_view_bf6/,Battlefield,1755799440.0,0,1.0,Battlefield 6
