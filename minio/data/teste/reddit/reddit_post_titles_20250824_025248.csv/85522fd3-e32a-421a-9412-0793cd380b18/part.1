‚Ç¨1200\~1500 have be available to buy within Ireland or from a company that will not have import fees added so no UK websites.

**Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
No

**How would you prioritize form factor (Ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
Thin and light as possible for the other requirements. Also would like it to be quite while doing general collage work as to not hinder other students.

**How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Weight and thinness are very important to me ‚Äî I‚Äôm looking for something easy to carry while traveling.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
14\~16""

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
Yes, Cad for modeling some light 3d models for 3d printing as well as small bit of gaming while traveling. Have a gaming desktop.

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
Play ark: ascended, war thunder, bf6 but generally not trying game on the laptop.

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Good Keyboard, good build quality, has to allow for usb-c charging even if only while running on integrated graphics.

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
Looking for a bit of help with this decision trying to keep the laptop as a work, study tool as opposed to gaming due to the fact that it would hinder my productivity but would be nice to have the option of some moderate gaming while traveling etc.¬†**Generally worried about being tethered to a wall socket while running basic applications for collage work.**

Have a few laptop's in mind but cant come to a final decision on any of them:

Option #1:¬†**Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 Gen 10 (16‚Äù AMD)**: R7 AI7 350, RTX 5050 8GB v-ram, 32gb ram, 1tb SSD

Like the option best because it would allow me to do Lenovo's advanced insurance for the 4 year care plan. But no Guaranteed shipping date and from some reviews the shipping can be delayed as its a build to order. Says ships within 6-9 days.

‚Ç¨1500\~ inc shipping and warranty

Option #2:¬†**Asus Vivobook Pro 15 Oled N6506CU:**¬†Intel¬Æ Core Ultra 9 Processor 285H\*\*,\*\* RTX 4050 6GB v-ram, 16gb ram, 1tb SSD.

Reason I like this option is it is currently available to order and delivery is within the week but no option for a extended warranty. From what I've read ram is expandible to at least 24gb ram according to ASUS website.

‚Ç¨1200

Open to further options but please share links.

I would buy a 1440p 144hz monitor at minimum. I was looking at the 4070 or 4070 Super and my processor (5600x) and it appears to get around 80-85fps on Ultra at 1440p. Is this good or mediocre?

How cool would it be if in BF6 there was a map that's in the dark and you need Night vision goggles (or sight) to see properly ? Maybe have buildings on the map that have actual lighting inside so you have to remove the NVGs in them to not be blinded. Flashlights would actually be useful too for once, either to see in the dark or to blind people that have NVGs.

I know that there are ""night"" maps in Battlefield, but they're usually not that dark. Missions with NVGs in campaigns are usually very cool, why is it limited to singleplayer ?

The only issue I see is that people might get bored or annoyed that a lot of the time they have to see in a single color for the duration of the match (green or white). That's why I think only one map or something should be like this.

I really want to upgrade few bits to better run games at 1440p - specifically BF6 when it launches in October

Should i sell the PC as a whole and build brand new AM5 build (posted on marketplace for. Bragain price ¬£670)

Or sell GPU and CPU and upgrade to 5700x3D / 9070  and remain within the end of life AM4 for a bit longer 

Or sell everything separately but keep PSU /SSD and go ahead with AM5 ?

I'm not entirely computer savvy when it comes to this stuff so a simple yes or no answer is fine!

I currently have an Asus tuf model FX505DD- BQ145T. Ive owned for roughly for 5ish years.

I upgraded the ram to 16gb and installed a secondary 1tb SSD in the spare slot.

I've never have any issues with it apart from the fans going wild with moderate use.

I now do a bit of content creation for a game I play which I record and stream IRL overhead gameplay with a camera + elgato camlink and OBS.

Sometimes these streams will go for 10+ hours non-stop as we are steaming card game events in store.

The last time I used my Asus (as it's a spar machine for me), about 8 hours in we had some issues with the stream dropping in frame rates which I'm assuming we may have reached the limitations of the Asus tuf.

I found an Asus tuf on clearance for around $1500AUD (FA506NCR-HN016W) or what I'm assuming is a more budget model (FA506NCR-HN040W) for $1100AUD.

Is it worth upgrading or are there some further modifications I can make to my current model that will be sufficient for what I use it for?

Also if I wanted to run game like fortnite, rivals, helldiver's, bf6 etc, would this still suffice? (I'm assuming not)

I tried playing bf6 and I wasn't too happy with the performance. I wanted to get the rx 9060xt, but realized I probably have to upgrade my CPU as well. (AM4 Motherboard)

My budget is tight at the moment so which option is the best:

1. Buy the 9060xt and wait for the CPU upgrade

2. Buy the CPU upgrade such as the r7 5800xt and then wait to upgrade GPU.

3. Wait until I can buy both because the bottleneck would be too limiting. 

This would be 1080p gaming. I don't care that much about 4k or 1440p and I prioritize FPS and the overall feel/smoothness but don't want to have to use low settings for single player games.  I play a lot of multiplayer games (r6, the finals, battlefield, marvel rivals etc.) But I also play a good amount of AAA single player ones as well and want to play some new titles (BM Wukong, MH Wilds, New Metal Gear, Stellar Blade etc.)

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hyped about and why:

* **Escalation mode** ‚Äì this could be a *really* fun new experience. If it‚Äôs dynamic and every match feels slightly different, it could become a core mode people keep coming back to.
* **Maps** ‚Äì the variety sounds great, no repeating biomes over and over. I‚Äôm especially hyped for Egypt ‚Äì exotic setting, verticality, and something totally fresh for BF.
* **Classes + weapon progression** ‚Äì finally we‚Äôll be able to push weapons further and keep leveling past the usual caps. Long-term motivation right there.
* **Portal** ‚Äì if Portal servers give you normal XP and rewards, that‚Äôs going to be insane. Creativity + progression = people will stay for hundreds of hours.
* **Campaign** ‚Äì I‚Äôm genuinely happy we‚Äôre getting this. After so many years, having a proper singleplayer story again is refreshing. If they nail the cutscenes and atmosphere, it will be a huge win.
* **Battle Royale** ‚Äì this could be massive if they do it *their way* and not just a Warzone/Apex copy. With BF‚Äôs scale and destruction, BR could actually stand out.
* **Battle Pass** ‚Äì not much to say yet, but if it‚Äôs not too grindy and has meaningful rewards, it‚Äôll work fine.
* **Ranked mode** ‚Äì I *really* hope this makes it in. Competitive ranked ladders are what keep a game alive for years. The motivation to climb, prove yourself every season reset, and earn unique rewards is exactly the kind of loop that makes people play non-stop.

Overall, I feel like DICE has set this up in a way that covers both casual fun and long-term progression/competitiveness. If they don‚Äôt screw it up with bad balancing or monetization, BF6 could finally be the Battlefield that lasts for years.

I think BF6 has a good chance of becoming the kind of game that many people play constantly, but somehow, mysteriously, never get tired of, and end up spending thousands of hours playing.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myehur/why_i_think_battlefield_6_has_a_really_strong/,Battlefield,1755986794.0,8,0.75,Battlefield 6

So just asking out of curiosity to grind for the bf6 rewards. I got bfv literally after bf6 and honestly I don't enjoy it as much as I want to. Gunplay is good, but visibility is so horrendous, general glitchiness and way too much sliding and jumping.

Played the best maps and I still don't feel they're the best on different modes too. I'm more of an infantry guy and whilst I love close quarters I don't feel the maps suited to the half player counts on combat for tdm, run so much only for shitty visibility to mean someone just shoots you out of somewhere so hard to see. There is pop in at close range even like being a few seconds on the same place and view. I do enjoy larger scale combat but only to a degree, I don't snipe and only play the vehicles a bit so that's a good majority of the player base I'm basically with. So if they did that well, like any other battlefield I'd be happy but the closest I felt I got was like on breakthrough with a appropriate player count and that you can operate as a soldier in decent ranges that aren't basically sniping and blowing up tanks, laying down supression or whatever. But even then a lot of maps are still shit with so much open space it's like a sniping gallery, twisted steel for instance. Fjell has it's jet problems still. I think it's made me appreciate less contrast in bf6 despite the artstyle perhaps not as great but still pretty good 

 I'm on ps5 running the PS4 version and and even after like 20 hours I think I'm done, but now I'm just wondering about trying bf 2042 and play it maybe whilst it's active... But I've also heard that it's genuinely got some of the most ass maps. Now it's had the reworks, what do you think has worse? If you want to answer before the reworks be my guest, I'd just say specify 

So BFV or BF2042. Also maybe one has worse maps then the other, but maybe it's best maps are better then the other? Lmk",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1myd1p2/which_has_worse_maps_bfv_or_2042/,Battlefield,1755983172.0,15,0.4,Discussion

Air vehicles are effective and fun despite feeling a bit odd. they fly much tighter compared to whatever the hell we got at launch and tank gameplay is actually solid! they got rid of the slow ass through the mud aiming since BF1 and you can actually have some fun playing aggro.

i wouldn't cry about balance yet but if the balance we gonna get is like the beta its gonna be pain. you are either a god or die in a second.

1myakrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,,3,Rog Ally/Rog Ally X Battlefield 2042 and 6 beta Lagging,ystolai,False,True,False,,False,"A lot of people are running into this issue in Battlefield 2042 (and also in the BF6 Beta), where the FPS warning icon pops up even when the game is running at 50‚Äì60 FPS or higher. The point is, it‚Äôs not just the icon showing up ‚Äî when it appears, the game actually lags: inputs feel delayed and even shots don‚Äôt register on the enemy.

In reality, this isn‚Äôt exactly an FPS problem but rather **Time Nudge (TN)**, a network metric Battlefield uses to measure synchronization between the client (your PC/handheld) and the server.

This ‚Äúphantom lag‚Äù happens because the **Rog Ally (and similar handhelds)** use a dynamic power management system that shifts power between CPU and GPU depending on the load. In heavy scenes, the CPU gets heavily taxed with graphics and can‚Äôt keep up with the constant back-and-forth communication with the server. The result: TN spikes, and the game interprets it as an FPS/network issue, triggering the warning ‚Äî along with real gameplay lag.

# The solution I found

What pretty much fixed it for me was **creating custom fixed power profiles on the Rog Ally**, both for plugged-in and battery mode:

* **Plugged in**:
   * SPL = 30W
   * SPPT = 30W
   * FPPT = 35W
* **On battery**:
   * SPL = 25W
   * SPPT = 25W
   * FPPT = 25W

With this setup, the problem is almost gone. The warning icon might still show up on very rare occasions, but it lasts less than 2 seconds and doesn‚Äôt really affect gameplay anymore.

# About packet loss

I was also experiencing a lot of **packet loss**, which triggered the network warning icon frequently. After checking the specs of the **Rog Ally X**, I noticed it supports **Wi-Fi 6E**, while my router was only Wi-Fi 5.  
Upgrading to a **Wi-Fi 6 router** made a huge difference ‚Äî now the packet loss warning rarely ever shows up.

# Why this works

1. **Fixed power delivery** ‚Üí prevents CPU/GPU power swings, keeping Time Nudge stable.
2. **Wi-Fi 6+ routers** ‚Üí offer better bandwidth, lower latency, and stronger stability for modern handhelds like the Rog Ally X.
   * Wi-Fi 5 can bottleneck these devices, especially in competitive online games.
   * Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) ensures more consistent communication with game servers, reducing both **lag spikes** and **packet loss**.

üëâ In short:  
Stabilize your **power profiles** \+ use at least a **Wi-Fi 6 router** = way smoother online experience on handhelds like the Rog Ally.",False,/r/ROGAlly/comments/1myakrc/rog_allyrog_ally_x_battlefield_2042_and_6_beta/,ROGAlly,1755977209.0,3,0.81,Discussion

Ive roughly followed youtubers settings guides like silk and ghost however ive made some adjustments that i find easier personally these are as follows

Instead of pitch up/down being on L Ctrl and Spacebar ive put them on w and s respectively basically swapping them (with it also bound to mouse for strafing ground targets)

 I've also been using roll on a and d rather than mouse and yaw is on mouse instead of a and d

Ive found these inputs easier for me to work with as im still youngling in fps gaming with a kb+m but im curious if any experienced players think im shooting myself in the foot with these changes as ive gotten to an average level i am really looking to get back to where i was at a minimum

I have to say, this is genuinely disappointing and worrying.

The beta felt fantastic. The pace was modern, frantic, and rewarding for aggressive, skilled play. Slowing everything down feels like a reactionary move to cater to a more passive, campy playstyle that has plagued other shooters.

This was our chance to have a true, fast-paced modern Battlefield. Slowing it down makes it feel more like a sluggish mil-sim than the all-out warfare sandbox we love. Please, DICE, don't sand down the edges that made the beta feel so fresh and engaging. Revert these changes.

Weekly missons can give you a total of 55 token which is equivalent to 5.5 levels. So total of weekly missions tokens would be 495 which is equivalent to 49.5 levels.
To farm faster in the game here is some tips:
1. Play conquest but play on close quarter mode where it's infantry based maps. You will be farming like there's no tomorrow 
2. Play the game during weekends due to XP boost weekend event. Playing during the weekends will give you 100% XP boost which could not only increase your level but faster to get the skins you want.
3. Play Support class to level up faster. By provide ammo, revives and suppress fire your your team and squadmates would give you more XP and lots of ribbons.

I‚Äôm looking for some upgrade advice and could use your input.

My current specs:
	‚Ä¢	CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
	‚Ä¢	GPU: Asus RTX 3070 8Gb
	‚Ä¢	Motherboard: MSI B450 A ProMax
	‚Ä¢	RAM: 16GB DDR4 (speed not sure, probably 3000 MHz or lower)

I mostly play Shooter on 1440p (Cs2) and Ive noticed that in the Bf6 Beta, which I'm looking forward to, my FPS isn‚Äôt as good as I‚Äôd like. From what I‚Äôve read, Battlefield tends to be CPU-heavy, so I suspect the 3600 might be my bottleneck.

My questions:
	‚Ä¢	Should I just upgrade the CPU (thinking about the Ryzen 7 5800X3D since it‚Äôs still AM4)?
	‚Ä¢	Or would it be smarter to also swap the motherboard to a B550 (and maybe new RAM later) for more features and ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù?

I‚Äôm not super well off financially, so ideally I‚Äôd like the best price-to-performance upgrade without rebuilding my whole systems.

Do you have any recommends?

People have every right not to play the mode or dislike it, but to hope it fails just because you don't like it. This makes no sense at all. 

EA has tried in the past to create a Battle Royale mode for Battlefield, in this case, Firestorm in BFV. However, it failed because it wasn't free, and no one who buys BF wants to play that, just the classic experience. BF2042's Hazard Zone mode was an extraction mode, but it failed because BF2042 is...BF2042 , so the mode didn't even have a chance to do anything.

Like every game company's goal, it wants to please existing players and attract new ones. BF6 is doing this; most people like it, and it's attracting a lot of people (especially those fleeing from BO7/Warzone). So a free mode also has this purpose, and if it's successful, it will attract players to buy the paid game. 

And this is very good for people who can't afford to pay $70 for a game and for people in third-world countries, which have lower purchasing power and a low-value currency. 

Warzone attracted a lot of people, but it also has some problems that Ripple Effect (the studio that will develop the mode) can't repeat:

- Integrating multiple games into a single mode. Warzone has about 200 weapons, and that's impossible to balance.

- Poor anti-cheat. 

- The game lacks its own identity; they change the movement and gunplay depending on the year's COD. 

- It's listened to by many streamers and content creators. 

- The game's philosophy has become basically a giant TDM. 

- Colored skins, even with the argument that it is a free game, harm the immersion and the purpose of the game.

- Lack of content after launch

We have little information about the mode; we don't know if it will be integrated into BF6 or how it will play. But we'll have BF Labs testing. My guess is after BF6's release; they don't want this to dampen the game's hype. 

There's a thought: if the mode is a success, EA will prioritize the free-to-play mode over the classic experience. Well, then, give me the lottery ticket, since you're predicting the future. We don't know what will happen and I think it's very unlikely.

But if Ripple Effect can create a mode that rewards team play, more tactical movement (not Milsim), sophisticated gunplay instead of a laser beam, has a lot of content, and maintains a more military feel, they already have a significant advantage over their competitors.

And that would be very good for the franchise and the community.

That's my opinion on the matter. You have every right to disagree.",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1my39lj/battle_royale_vs_battlefield_community_my_opinion/,Battlefield,1755960161.0,20,0.72,Battlefield 6

Yes, the hate it gets are mostly justified, but what are some of the things (big or small) you think 2042 actually did right or you just like?

  
For examples here are some things i personally really dig:     

\-The conquest ""sector"" system, its much easier to disrupt enemy majority or even turn the table around without needing to actually control more objectives than enemy. I think this has a lot of potentials to create some really interesting match outcomes when implemented well in certain maps.      

\-Skipping revive doesn't drain your timer is a welcome qol detail to me. In bfv and bf6 there are many times i cant reach and revive my squadmates in time because they skipped half their timer before i could tag them. The 2042 system makes it more streamlined for medics because basically all the people waiting for revives now have a much more consistent timer.        

\-Hourglass's sandstorm is not only visually stunning, i think its also the first time they finally find the balance between gimmick and gameplay. It only blocks your view for the first few seconds and it takes no time to return to sunny days. Making it more of a cool intermission event and don't feel like it could last half a match like in Sinai deserts.        

\-The announcers are underrated imo, coming from bf1 siri and bfv. I think its really cool that we now have multiple announcers working together as a team themselves, (i especially like the detail that sometimes announcer tells you how the match is going on because you overheard the commander asking for status report on the radio, not just because commander feels the need to tell you personally like in most other games).

I've watched several people stream the games before but am a new player to the franchise.

I did the intro conquest mission and tried queueing on 64 player conquest map, but the count maybe goes up to 3 and then drops back down to 1/64.

Is there a way to search for fuller lobbies or servers that have more active players?

Do I need to level up more to find matches with more people in it or how can I play this game?

I tried one match with bots when the lobby stayed empty for 20 mins, but I'm thinking of refunding and maybe rather getting something else as I wanted to play PVP FPS BF style game, like Battlebit. I enjoyed it!

I'm also not sure if I'll be spending money at the premium price point of BF6, if this is how low the interest in Battlefield is in my region, without any server browser or wider matchmaking. I don't mind playing at 150ms ping or anything below 250ms, if it means I get to play. But this game does not seem to give that option.

I mostly play for fun, not competitive.

I wanted to play this in anticipation for BF6 but seeing how few people play this here in South Africa, even on a weekend and a 95% sale.

Opinions are different for everyone but I feel I need to state this as BF2042 was always highly criticized. 
Let me start by saying I‚Äôve played and own all BF‚Äôs, my favorite being BF3. 
We all know the comment ‚ÄúBF4 is just BF3 but more polished‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be more untrue. 
BF3 had much more enjoyable maps, assignments and core mechanics. 
Not only that, but the graphics and overall visuals / color palette hold up better. BF4 also tends to have buggy textures and overall worse graphics. 
But let‚Äôs focus this thread on the comparison between BF4 and 2042. BF4 suffers from a horrible netcode and lag. I can‚Äôt even state how many times I was running behind cover while shot and got killed while I was already Ls‚Äùsafe‚Äù. Hitmark detection in 4 is bad. Also too many times when I see an enemy appear in my screen for a split second, I‚Äôm already dead. I recorded multiple clips to analyze this phenomenon and I was right. Maybe because I have extremely low ping (1000mbps fibre glass internet) and the opponent or BF server is laggy.  
Whatever the reason, it‚Äôs really shitty. Combat and gunplay become really annoying. 
2042 on the other hand is buttery smooth and a 1:1 representation of how your brain perceives things. It‚Äôs just much more up to date and modern feeling. 
Another thing I can‚Äôt stand about bf4 is how the maps in my opinion mostly suck. Everyone is wild about shanghai, but in my eyes it‚Äôs just some skyscrapers and some roads with a bridge.. don‚Äôt get me started on 24/7 golmud maps. Golmud is a shit map, there I said it. 
I actually believe that 2042 maps are more enjoyable than a lot of bf4 maps (inb4 downvotes, idc). 
Spearhead gives me this very open feeling and gives me windows xp fever dream vibes. Orbital has an actual rocket launch during the battle. Overall I think the maps are a little blend but still give a lot of play room for different tactics and approaches. And they look gorgeous. 
The gadgets in 2042 give the player a shitton of cool new ways to battle the enemy. For example using a guided rocket to take down a chopper with your controller is much more interesting and effective than just aiming an igla, waiting for the aircraft to deploy flares and then try again..
I do hate the whole specialist characters in 2042 but the gear is better. 

If I wanted the old school BF maps and vibes I‚Äôll just play my baby BF3. BF4 just seems like a very confused release with bad maps.. I mean there are some good dlc maps like dragon valley but no server rolls these maps. It‚Äôs mostly flood, golmud, metro etc. 
Bf4 graphics, lag and netcode are also horrible imo. 
Not to forget that the game became really sweaty. Tons of vehicle campers, people using team resources like jets to get their asses up a skyscraper just to snipe and be useless etc‚Ä¶

Again, this was not meant as a war between the two games, but more to show people 2042 is actually really good (now) and I couldn‚Äôt imagine going back to bf4. 

To sum it all up; gameplay and gunplay wise, 2042 is much more correct and smooth. Combat is satisfying and more fair. Requires skills, less (or no) netcode failure. Maps in my eyes are very interesting. Serene, futuristic but not over the top. People call it a walking simulator. That‚Äôs really a far stretch and I love them more than the maps we‚Äôve seen in the bf6 beta. I love the gadgets giving you unique ways to play. Graphics are very refreshing and high quality. 

The reason for this thread was primarily to encourage more people to try out 2042. It received so much criticism while it‚Äôs actually a smooth, crisp, intelligent and fair Battlefield game. Especially wanted to put an emphasis on this since a lot of people are on BF4, just like I was, not knowing better. But in retrospect, BF4 is just a buggy, laggy ugly mess. If I want the old school BF feel and maps, I‚Äôll go to BF3 which is much better in every way.

	‚Ä¢	Ryzen 7 9800X3D, PBO -25 with +150 MHz (pbo motherboard)

	‚Ä¢	MSI Edge Ti B850 (latest BIOS installed)

	‚Ä¢	Corsair iCUE LINK Titan 360 RX LCD, top-mounted in a Corsair 3500X

‚Ä¢	Previously: Corsair H150i Elite Capellix (front-mounted intake) in an iCUE 465X ‚Üí ~86¬∞C max on CB23/24 before the pump died this sum

	‚Ä¢	Thermal paste: tried both the pre-applied paste and Noctua NT-H2 (reapplied twice) ‚Üí same results
	‚Ä¢	  Corsair dominator tunned 6200 C28 RAM

	‚Ä¢	MSI 5070 Ti Gaming Trio undervolted to 3000 MHz @ 0.950 V (60-65C with low fans rpm in games)

	‚Ä¢	Airflow: 3x RX120 side intake, 1x RX140 bottom intake, 1x RX120 rear exhaust, 3x RX120 radiator top exhaust 

	‚Ä¢	Ambient: ~27‚Äì30¬∞C (Paris, during summer, top floor under the roof, no AC)

	‚Ä¢	Liquid temps: from 35C after cold boot to 40-41 max. 

Temps:
	‚Ä¢	Cinebench R23/R24 ‚Üí spikes to 90+¬∞C within seconds, peaks ~94¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	BF6 beta (40vs40 large maps) ‚Üí ~70¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	CS2 (1280x1024, 500 FPS) ‚Üí ~60‚Äì65¬∞C
	‚Ä¢	Idle ‚Üí 46‚Äì50¬∞C

Here‚Äôs what confuses me:
When I start Cinebench, the CPU hits 90¬∞C almost instantly (within a few seconds), but the liquid temp barely rises and usually stays around 38‚Äì40¬∞C. That makes me wonder if the heat transfer from the IHS to the coldplate is happening correctly. If the cooler was saturated, I‚Äôd expect the liquid to climb much higher, but it doesn‚Äôt.

The pump is fine (shows ~3000 rpm in iCUE, liquid temps stable), so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a pump issue. Since paste doesn‚Äôt change anything (stock or NT-H2 gave identical results), I‚Äôm starting to suspect contact quality with the IHS, even though I made sure to mount it properly and tightened it in a cross pattern.

So I‚Äôm trying to figure out if:
	1.	It‚Äôs just the ambient heat (27‚Äì30¬∞C room temp vs 20‚Äì21¬∞C for others)
	2.	The TITAN 360 RX is simply underperforming vs other 360mm AIOs
	3.	Or if my AIO contact/coldplate quality might be the issue

I could always cap PBO to lower PPT, but I was hoping a 360mm AIO would handle this CPU without needing this.

Any recommendations, tips, or similar experiences with the TITAN 360 RX would be super appreciated!",False,/r/Corsair/comments/1mxwihk/9800x3d_titan_360_rx_lcd_peaking_at_94c_in/,Corsair,1755939786.0,26,0.99,Help

I am nearing my wit's end, so I have come here to hopefuly gather some wise wizardry. Here's the story

2 weeks ago I installed Battlefield 6 open Beta. It required me to enable Safe Boot ; for that I had to update my BIOS. Then I had to update my GPU drivers, which I did via the AMD software, as usual. No other changes were made, and I was able to play the game for the weekend.

In the following week and up until now, i've had multiple BSOD that are have a rather unpredictable timing : they can happen on the window login screen, or I can browse for hours on Firefox without any crash, go take a shit, and then boom, BSOD while the PC is idle.

The BSOD have a different message each time, but it's always a ""visually glitched"" BSOD (think 4 BSOD on the upper screen, and a ""mosaic of what was on the screen before the crash"" on the bottom).

Here is what I have tried so far :

\- Restore to a ""before BF6"" => no effect on BSOD

\- clean uninstall and reinstall of AMD drivers => no effect on BSOD

\- updated BIOS to the latest non-beta version => no effect on BSOD

\- ran memtest86 on my only RAM stick = no error detected (2 pass)

\- ran Window's memory diag tool => no error detectedf (full test)

\- ran windows repair tools (chdsk, dism, sfc) => no effect on BSOD

\- reinstalled Windows (while keeping my data, not the clean slate reinstall) => no effect on BSOD

\- ran Verifier to check non-window drivers => 2 crashes so far, one a few minutes after boot, the other a few hours after boot.

\-Ran Windows antivirus on full scan => found only 3 old trojans i've had for years.

Up until two days ago i was using WhoCrashed to read the DMP files, but it was not very helful, as the crash types are all over the place. Now i'm using BlueScreenviewer and it's consistenly targeting ""ntoskrnl.exe+3fd510"", which if i'm understanding correctly, is Windows ""master driver"", although it could be not directly linked to this, but rather to something it's trying to access/use (right ?).

I have not done anything yet on the hardware side yet.

I don't know what more to do to find the root of the issue. Can you guys help me ? (i've had 2 more BSOD while writing this post)

Are explosions sending tanks into the sky realistic?

Is it realism for a tank to piggyback on a jet to shoot other jets down? 

Battlefield has always been less of a twitch shooter sure, but the best most hype parts of the games have always been unrealistic and unintended by the devs. 

That's what ""Only in Battlefield"" means! it's the exciting unexpected moments and use of mechanics that weren't explicitly designed in, that weren't accounted for, and you couldn't find them anywhere else.

Then over time I began to play Battlefield Bad Company 2 and thought it was a decent version of Battlefield in terms of combat feel, but the award and ranking system didn't even come close to OG BF2. Battlefield 3 released and I felt it was just hyper visualized graphic slop with no push towards actual squad teamwork and seemed more like CoD. Battlefield 4 was released and was like an updated skin of Battlefield 3 and didnt feel much better and this is where I pretty much stopped with the whole Battlefield series. This series has turned into complete low IQ slop for people who just want to run and gun, and feel like rambo, rather than actually captuing the essence of working together with a Squad. Battlefield 2 and BFBC2 didn't push squad teamwork like crazy, but it definitely felt like it had more of teamwork military mentality. Fastword through all the Battlefields that are just woke garbage or hollywood simulators, now we have Battlefield 6. Which I think steps back toward Battlefield 3 and 4, which again BF6 is just hyper visualized graphical slop for low IQ normies, imo. BF6 is honestly trash and why it's trash, is because it doesn't really push any sort of military squad training or push tactical teamwork. I really never understood why people enjoy playing a military like shooter where all it is, is me, me, me, and my K/D score.  Battlefield 6 is 100% garbage and will be tossed aside like the rest of this series in a year or 2 for the next EA Battlefield slop release. The award and ranking system for BF6 is also horrid and once again their just handing out medals and ribbons for really nothing.

1mxt0he,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mxt0he,,1,I bought a controller for pure aesthetics only and here is my experience. (Kingdom Come Deliverance Controller),Daft-SKULL-FACE,False,False,False,,False,"So you can I bought this controller from AIM simply because they had this really nice Kingdom Come Deliverance styled controller. I didn‚Äôt buy it for performance, paddles, mouse click triggers, none of that. I already have a ton of ‚ÄúPro‚Äùcontrollers and just like to collect unique nice looking ones. Anyways here goes my review‚Ä¶

The design is top notch the faceplate has a really nice shine to it and it matches the games aesthetic perfectly! 

The customization process was easy but the Xbox side of ‚Äúdesign your own‚Äù is WAY behind in comparison of how much you can customize the PS5 controllers‚Ä¶ which I understand that those sell more but even still‚Ä¶ they should at least update the ‚ÄúBuild your own‚Äù options to at least match. Kind of a bummer but not the end of the world.

Price‚Ä¶. Oof. Again I got NO ‚ÄúPro‚Äù enhancements‚Ä¶only thing I got that was close to it was changing the thumb stick bases and that was already a free change of color. It‚Äôs nice that I can swap out the thumb stick heights but again all I did was change the colors of a few buttons which did cost some money and added the Logo on the left. Here is a breakdown of price.

-KCD Faceplate +$25
-Black ABXY Buttons +$7 
-Dpad Color Black +$6
-start and Select color Change +$2.50
-Logo +$19
-Shipping DHL +$23.99

So in TOTAL I ended up paying 
$141.72 including shipping, add ons, and tax‚Ä¶ and that was even with a 15% off coupon. So price for just cosmetics being Double what standard controllers are isn‚Äôt the worst thing ever but I will say for 100% Certain‚Ä¶ DO NOT ADD A LOGO. It is basically a sticker they slap on‚Ä¶ and on the Xbox controllers you have no say as to where exactly they put it. I asked them to center it on the chainmail and they did not. On the PS5 editor it allows you to move it around‚Ä¶ again Xbox gets treated like 2nd class citizens here‚Ä¶

Last thing I will gripe about here is the the worst thing about AIM‚Ä¶. Shipping. If you order without speedy AIM shipping (An additional $50!!?!) basically be ready to wait anywhere between 2-3 months for the controller to actually be built and shipped to you‚Ä¶. Also you are at the mercy of parts delays so if they say they are waiting on parts‚Ä¶ big oof‚Ä¶ you just gotta wait and wait‚Ä¶ but hey don‚Äôt worry pay an extra $50 on top of your already expensive controller and they will get it to you in 3 business days! üòÅ‚Ä¶ like what? 3 days or 3 months are your only options?!?!? This is the absolute worst thing about AIM and may effect your purchase if you hate waiting super long like most of us‚Ä¶.

Overall I know most of this sounded bad‚Ä¶ but I wana say that the controller I got is everything I wanted. A beautiful looking controller designed by me with the colors I love and themed after a game I care deeply about. Controller itself 10/10. Experience in actually getting the controller from build time, price, Logo that was Literaly just a sticker, and SHIPPING TIME‚Ä¶. Ugh‚Ä¶. 4/10‚Ä¶ and again shipping without speedy AIM is what makes this whole thing feel really bad‚Ä¶ especially becuase it makes you feel like they just don‚Äôt work on your controller at all and just work on all the speedy AIM people first.. feels like you get skipped over and if you are an Xbox guy like me even more-so with the lack of duality with the customizer compared to the PS5 customization.

Would I recommend AIM to others? For me it depends on what you are wanting‚Ä¶ if you love the style of the controllers then sure! They do have a ton of themed ones that are fantastic looking! BF6, Black Ops 6, Minecraft, Kingdom Come Deliverance(The best one imo lol) the look of them are AMAZING. But if you aren‚Äôt willing to shell out the extra $50 to get your controller in a decent time frame‚Ä¶. Welp it just depends how long you are willing to wait/ how much patience you have. Because they will make you wait and make you wait LONG.

I hope this helps anyone who is looking to get a controller from them and debating the Speedy AIM option for shipping‚Ä¶ imo AIM just really needs to work on shipping and build times‚Ä¶ 3 months is kinda unacceptable especially when they are touting 16-21 business days on the website‚Ä¶

I'm looking for a gaming bestie. I have some long-term friends who game but they're not SUPER available, now are they super into the same games that I play a ton of the time, and they never want to like \*actually\* complete a game. we just hop around like crazy and never get deep into a game.

I'm a HUGE RuneScape player (oldschool, iron man BTW!) so if you're into that, that would be sick, but I'm looking to get into ARPGs more. I've never gotten to like ""endgame"" in an ARPG even though I've played many, and I really want to actually like experience the endgame in those types of games. Right now I just started Last Epoch while waiting for PoE 2 to get updated, and I'm also interested in trying PoE 1.

I also like co-op games. Think Deep Rock Galactic, Peak, Sworn, Killing Floor 2, Left 4 Dead, stuff like that. I'm not a super huge competitive gamer anymore, although I enjoy DBD sometimes, I was a huge overwatch nerd back in the day but that gameplay loop doesn't really appeal to me anymore nowadays. (Although I am excited for BF6)

Right now I'm pretty available as I'm looking for work and gaming is my main hobby so I'm looking for someone who's down to talk in discord for like hours and game together, I recently got divorced so I'm kinda looking for somebody to fill that ""lonely"" void and help distract me from those feelings.

If this sounds good to you just DM me! I'm also hoping to find someone who I can be really great friends with, maybe even outside of gaming. Like talking about our days and supporting one another and stoof.

&nbsp;

Been digging around for a while to get a decent value buy, and have landed on the following.

&nbsp;

All values are in AUD.

&nbsp;

Used Lenovo Legion Pro 7i 2024 Gen 9 16"" 240Hz QHD+ i9-14900HX 32GB 1TB/1TB RTX 4080 for about ~$2500. No idea on warranty remaining, its a 2024 model.

&nbsp;

Used Msi Raider 16‚Äù i9 4090 32 GB DDR5 2TB SSD gaming laptop. 1 year warranty left, until July 2026. ~$3000.

&nbsp;

New Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 16"" WQXGA Core Ultra 9 32GB RAM 1TB RTX Gaming laptop. 5090 is $5500, 5080 is $4800.

&nbsp;

I am leaning towards the Used Lenovo legion 4080, as I think the value for money is there, but obviously its taking a risk as I don't know how well it has been looked after. I think if I went for a new one, I would just buy the 5090, as the extra 700$ at those prices doesn't make much of a difference.

First off thanks to this community for all the information thrown around. Really helped me research the best way to go about this. 

After playing BF6 and my old pc not keeping up for whatever reason (i5 9600k & 2080ti - I wanted a new pc anyway) I decided to do SFF because mid tower is just so unnecessarily big. Getting the same power in a smaller form just makes more sense. And it‚Äôs a niche little project not all are willing to put the work in for. 

That being said I‚Äôm very happy with how this build came out. The M2 was a very fun case to build in. Super customizable to whatever orientation you want to do. I went with level 9 VGPU because I‚Äôve always wanted to do one. Although I know the temps may not be the best in comparison I just think it looks cooler. After taking probably 5 different tries with the cable management, I was finally able to get it to my personal standard. I watched a couple YouTube videos that did similar builds. Everything fit like a glove. I took off the top portion of the corsair pump to help the gpu fit. I didn‚Äôt have a problem with it but it just felt too close for comfort. But there is still plenty of space in the whole setup. Debating on rising the GPU and placing fans at the bottom but im going to see how the temps hold up over time. 

Currently playing on 1440p pushing over 150fps on average. I have not seen temps go over 65C on CPU/GPU full load so I‚Äôm very happy. I live in SoCal and apartment stays around 72-74F.  Any questions ask away! I can‚Äôt wait to tinker more with this build. SFF is the way to go!

Dude, I just want to have fun again",EagleGhoul,1755916593.0,True,False,,False,"The best thing traditionally about battlefield is it is a low stress, FUN shooter. Everything else has become about being hyper competitive and overwhelming to casual players. Guess what, most people who buy the game are not MLG pro players, Vtubers, streamers. They're regular people who just want to play battlefield and have FUN.

I'll get some kills, I'll get killed. I'm good enough at the game to have fun, that's all I and a vast majority of people care about. There are other games to be super competitive. Sorry those games all suck now and streamers are chomping at the bit for any new game they can squeeze content, views, and money out of, but I don't really care. They're not the majority.

All of the losers crying and saying ""you just suck"" or this is ""just for 40 year old dads"" or whatever... brother, what is wrong with you? You are mad because people want to have fun with a video game? Are we really that braindead now that practicing movement for hours and hours and dunking on everyone else is what is fun and everyone else just sucks? 

Battlefield is fun because once you learn how to play with your squad and team (something that takes considerably less time than practicing sweaty movement maneuvers), the game is rewarding you'll do well.  40 year old dad, 15 year old kid, whatever. I'm in my mid 20s and gaming is a casual thing for me to have fun. That's what I come to battlefield for. Kudos to DICE for listening to the playerbase and not the people with the loud platforms. 

The feedback from the beta is promising and bf6 is shaping up to be an incredible game. 


TLDR: I feel like games, especially multiplayer games nowadays, try to follow the hyper-competitive mega-skill family tree. I just want to play games and have fun again. Bf6 is fun so far.  The  point is to keep it that way and all the streamers/sweats mad about it just reinforces why it's so important

COME AT ME EA",YalrightSarah2020,False,True,False,,False,"I‚Äôm concerned about the open vs closed weapons discussion. I think the developers need to take a stance, and closed weapons are the better choice if they want Battlefield to keep its depth and identity.

When every class can use every weapon, it removes the team-oriented roles that make Battlefield unique. 
In Battlefield 3, for example, you always felt like you needed to be near other players. In 2042, medics would just sit back and snipe instead of engaging with the team.

That doesn‚Äôt fit the grounded and immersive atmosphere that BF6 has been nailing. The marketing says ‚Äúteamplay,‚Äù but the gameplay ends up rewarding lone-wolfing. It didn‚Äôt feel right in the beta.

A semi-closed pool, like BF1 where carbines and DMRs were cross-class, could actually work well. But what we saw in 2042 flattened the experience. It made every class feel the same and made your choice of role in the squad feel meaningless.

And with no server browser for official modes, apart from Portal which in my experience is less active, it‚Äôs easier for the devs to push open-weapon playlists to the forefront. Open weapons will always look more appealing to newer or casual players because fewer rules feel like more freedom, but that freedom comes at the cost of balance, direction, and a stable skill ceiling. It‚Äôs hard to really improve at a certain playstyle when the game itself keeps shifting between two very different approaches.

Only my opinion, and I‚Äôd love to be wrong because I want this game to be great. Thoughts?",False,/r/Battlefield/comments/1mxms9d/open_weapons_look_fun_but_theyre_killing_teamplay/,Battlefield,1755907692.0,56,0.37,Battlefield 6

One of my favorite activities in Bf4 was figuring out different ways to capture/control a skyscraper and using them as a jump off point to traverse the rest of the map via parachute. Not to mention the suspense of not knowing what is at the top of the elevator and who might be camping in it. I wonder if the engine has been reengineered to prioritize smaller more dense maps with less verticality to ensure that the destruction is well optimized and doesn‚Äôt impede gameplay. I hope the devs find a way to incorporate skyscrapers later on in the game‚Äôs lifecycle because they make for great setpieces and create really interesting gameplay possibilities.
